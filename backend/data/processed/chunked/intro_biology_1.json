Two important types of bonds exist in living things:  \ncharges. Ionic reactions occur when atoms combine and lose or gain electrons. When sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) combine, for example, sodium loses an electron to chlorine. Sodium becomes the positively charged sodium ion (Na + ), and chlorine becomes the negatively charged  \n- chloride ion (Cl \u2013  \n) \u2013  \n). These two oppositely charged ions are attracted to each other, forming an ionic bond. \u2713 Covalent bonds are formed when atoms share electrons in a covalent reaction. When two oxygen atoms join together to form oxygen gas, they share two pairs of electrons with each other. Each shared pair of electrons is one covalent bond, so the two pairs of shared electrons in a molecule of oxygen gas have a double bond. Covalent bonds are\n- extremely important in biology because they hold together the backbones of all biological molecules. Acids and Bases (Not a Heavy Metal Band)"

Synthesis means making something. If you really think about it, in dehydration synthesis, something must be made when water is removed. That's exactly what happens. When glucose and fructose get together, a water molecule is removed from the monosaccharides and given off as a byproduct of the reaction. The opposite of dehydration synthesis is hydrolysis.

You dry out because water is removed (but not completely) from some cells, such as those in your tongue, to make sure more important cells, like those in your heart or brain, continue to function. Synthesis means making something. If you really think about it, in dehydration synthesis, something must be made when water is removed. That's exactly what happens. When glucose and fructose get together, a water molecule is removed from the monosaccharides and given off as a byproduct of the reaction. The opposite of dehydration synthesis is hydrolysis. A hydrolysis reaction breaks down a larger sugar molecule into its original monosaccharides. When something undergoes hydrolysis, a water molecule splits a compound (hydro means \"water\"; lysis means \"break apart\"). When sucrose is added to water, it splits apart into glucose and fructose.  \n5/7/10 11:43 PM  \n<!-- image -->  \n07\\_598757-ch03.indd 39  \nChapter 3: The Chemistry of Life  \nConverting glucose for storage purposes  \nCarbohydrates are found in nearly every food, not just bread and pasta.

Synapsis happens when the two chromosomes of each pair find each other and stick together. The synapsis process begins when the homologous chromosomes move and lie next to each other. At this point, the two homologous chromosomes can swap equal amounts of DNA in an event called crossing-over (see Figure 6-6a) . This swapping of materials  \nresults in four completely unique chromatids. This new arrangement of four chromatids is called a tetrad. Crossing-over between homologous chromosomes during prophase I increases the genetic variability among gametes produced by the same organism.

But that's not all. Prophase I is when something that's absolutely critical to the successful separation of homologous chromo-  \n- somes occurs: synapsis. Synapsis happens when the two chromosomes of each pair find each other and stick together. The synapsis process begins when the homologous chromosomes move and lie next to each other. At this point, the two homologous chromosomes can swap equal amounts of DNA in an event called crossing-over (see Figure 6-6a) . This swapping of materials  \nresults in four completely unique chromatids. This new arrangement of four chromatids is called a tetrad. Crossing-over between homologous chromosomes during prophase I increases the genetic variability among gametes produced by the same organism. Every time meiosis occurs, crossing-over can happen a little differently, shuffling the genetic deck as gametes are made. This is one of the reasons that siblings can be so different from each other.  \n5/7/10 11:45 PM  \n<!-- image -->  \n11\\_598757-ch06.indd 95  \nChapter 6: Dividing to Conquer: Cell Division  \n\u2713 Metaphase I: This is when the pairs of homologous chromosomes line up in the center of the cell.

The tall parent's alleles are shown as TT, and the short parent's alleles are shown as tt. Because both of their alleles are the same, the parental pea plants are homozygous for the plant height trait (homo- means \"same,\"  \n- and zygous comes from a Greek root that means \"together\"). 2. Each parental pea plant gives one allele to each offspring. Because the parentals are purebred, they can give only one type of allele. Tall pea plant parents always give a copy of the tall allele (T) to offspring, and short parents always give a copy of the short allele (t). Copies of these alleles are packaged into gametes (sperm and egg cells) as the pea\n- plants reproduce. 3.

These objects are evidence of I  \nbones or tools from ancient ancestors. These objects are evidence of  \nhow humans have changed and expanded their knowledge over the millenia.  \nIn other words, they provide perspective on how the human species has evolved. But what was the starting point of evolution, and from what did the earliest humans evolve? This chapter tells you about the beliefs people had regarding evolution; how Charles Darwin came up with his theory of biological evolution; and what the current thoughts are on the origin of species, how humans have evolved, and how life on Earth began. Prepare to be amazed by the proof researchers have found for biological evolution and find out some pretty fascinating facts about how things used to be and how they've changed. What People Used to Believe From the time when ancient Greece was the world's cultural hotspot until  \nthe early 1800s, philosophers, scientists, and the general public believed that"

Over time, as horses moved onto open grasslands, they evolved into much larger, long-legged animals. \u2713 Disruptive selection: In this type, the environment favors extreme or unusual traits and selects against the common traits. One example is the height of weeds in lawn grass compared with in the wild. In the wild, natural state, tall weeds compete for the resource of light better than short weeds. But in lawns, weeds have a better chance of surviving if\n- they remain short because grass is kept short. \u2713 Sexual selection: Females increase the fitness of their offspring by choosing males with superior fitness; females are therefore concerned with quality. Males contribute most to the fitness of a species by maximizing the quantity of offspring they produce. Because males are concerned with quantity, competition between males for opportunities to mate  \n5/7/10 11:53 PM  \n190 Part III: It\u2019s a Small, Interconnected World exists in contests of strength.

Three decades later, their son Richard noticed the jaw of a saber-toothed tiger sticking out of the archaeological site. Digging continued in the area, and eventually pieces of three skeletons were unearthed. The skeletons were also classified as those of Homo  \n- habilis and were dated at about 2 million years old. The Leakeys continued their work at Olduvai Gorge well into the 1980s, and in 1984, they unearthed a spectacular find: the first (and still the only) full skeleton of a Homo erectus, dated at 1.6 million years old. \u2713 In 1994, Richard Leakey's wife, Meave, headed upstream from Olduvai Gorge to Kanapoi in northern Kenya and found a 4.2-million-year-old hominid ancestor. The lower jaw was complete, and the teeth were surprisingly like those of a modern human. However, the shape of the jaw was like that of a chimpanzee. Pieces of lower leg bone were also found,"

Whether these potential pathogens cause you harm depends on a complicated give and take between their invasion tools and your defenses. You emerge the winner from the vast majority of your microbial encounters due to the combination of your innate immunity (a built-in immune system that all humans have) and your adaptive immunity (the part of your immune system that develops as you encounter microbes). In this chapter, we present the structures and cells that keep you safe from microbes and review the options available to you when your body's defenses need a helping hand.

These capillaries are highly selective about what they allow to enter the brain or cerebrospinal fluid.

If you're wondering what happens to the neurotransmitter after it binds to the receptor, here's the story: After the neurotransmitter produces its effect, whether that effect is excitation or inhibition, it's released by the receptor and goes back into the synapse. In the synapse, enzymes degrade the chemical neurotransmitter into smaller molecules. Then the presynaptic cell \"recycles\" the degraded neurotransmitter, sending the chemicals back into the presynaptic membrane so that during the next impulse, when the synaptic vesicles bind to the presynaptic membrane, the complete neurotransmitter can again be released. Table 18-2 lists some common neurotransmitters and their functions.

It has erectile tissue and a glans tip, just like  \npubic bone) fills with blood, and the increased pressure causes drops of fluid to be squeezed out of the tissue. This lubrication prepares the vagina for sexual intercourse so the erect penis can be inserted into it easily. When the penis is fully inside the vagina, the tip of the penis is as close as possible to the woman's cervix. The cervix is the bottom end of the uterus, which extends down into the vagina. Sperm must travel through the cervix to enter the uterus. During sexual intercourse, sperm travel from the man's epididymides (tubules in the scrotum that store produced sperm) to his vas  \ndeferens, tubes that carry sperm from the scrotum to the urethra so they can be ejaculated. The actions that occur during sexual intercourse serve to bring the man and woman to the climax of stimulation, which is followed shortly by orgasm.  \nVertebrae Urinary bladder  \nPubic bone  \nRectum  \nSeminal vesicle  \nBulbourethral  \n(Cowper's) gland  \nVas deferens  \nEpididymis  \nFrom LifeART\u00ae, Super Anatomy 1, \u00a9 2002, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins  \n<!-- image -->  \n26\\_598757-ch19.indd 305  \n5/8/10 12:05 AM  \n306 Part IV: Systems Galore!

The negative pressure in the leaves and xylem\n- exerts a pulling force on the water in the plant's xylem and draws the water upward. When water molecules stick to each other through cohesion (where like \u2014 as opposed to different \u2014 substances stick together), they fill the column in the xylem and act as a huge single molecule of water. As water evaporates from the plant through transpiration, the rest of the water gets pulled up, causing the need for more water to be pulled into the plant.
