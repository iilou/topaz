This can be tested by finding out the Polanski number\n- Acetyl Number: It is defined as the amount in millilitres of potassium hydroxide solution required to neutralise the acetic acid obtained by saponification of 1 gm of fat or oil after acetylation. Some fatty acids contain hydroxyl groups. In order to determine the proportion of these, they are acetylated by means of acetic anhydride. This results in the introduction of acetyl groups in the place of free hydroxyl groups. The acetic acid in combination with fat can be determined by titration of the liberated acetic acid from acetylated fat or oil with standard alkali. Acetyl number is thus a measure of the number of hydroxyl groups present in fat or oil.  \n- Acid Number: It is defined as the milligram of potassium hydroxide required to neutralise the free fatty acids present in one gram of fat or oil. Acid number indicates the amount of free fatty acids present in fat or oil. The free fatty acid content increases with age of the fat or oil."

Metal-activated enzymes bind metals less tightly but require added metals. The distinction between metalloenzymes and metal activated enzymes thus rests on the affini.ty of a particular enzyme for its metal ion. The mechanisms whereby metal ions perform their function appear to be similar both in metallo enzymes and metal activated enzymes. Metals participate through their ability to act as Lewis acids and through chelate formation. Example of a metal functioning as a Lewis acid is the zinc in carbonic anhydrase. The metal can also promote. catalysis by binding substrate at the site of bond cleavage. In carboxypeptidase, the carbonyl oxygen is chelated to the zinc."

By a series of electron shifts and rearrangements, the pyridoxal phosphate becomes pyridoxamine phosphate. The amino acid is oxidatively deaminated to form the corresponding a-keto acid. The a-amino group is then transferred to a new a-keto acid to change it to an amino acid. pp also acts as coenzyme in the decarboxylation, desulphuration, transulphuration reactions associated with amino acid metabolism."

        "embedding_text": "Vitamin C is found in fresh fruits and vegetables including citrus fruits. Vitamin C is necessary for the health of the supporting tissues of the body such as bone, cartilage and connective tissue.  \nDeficiency in vitamin C leads to the disease scurvy due to the role of the vitamin in the post-translational modification of collagens. Scurvy is characterized by easily bruised skin, muscle fatigue, soft swollen gums, decreased wound healing and hemorrhaging, osteoporosis, and anemia.  \nVitamin C is readily absorbed and so the primary cause of vitamin C deficiency is poor diet and/or an increased requirement. The primary physiological state leading to an ihcreased requirement for vitamin C is severe stress (or trauma). This is due to a rapid depletion in the adrenal stores of the vitamin. The reason for the decrease in adrenal vitamin C levels is unclear but may be due either to redistribution of the vitamin to areas that need it or an overall increased utilization."

(On the mammalian enzyme the 60 subunits of the transacetylase seem to form a pool of lipoyl groups among which the acetyl groups are freely exchanged).  \n<!-- image -->  \nNote that in the reactions of dihydrolipoyl transacetylase the lipoamide has been reduced from a disulphide to two sulphhydryl groups. In order to continue operation lipoamide must be reoxidized and that is accomplished by the final enzyme of the complex, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase. The reactions catalyzed by this enzyme are complex, but the net result is the transfer of two electrons from the lipoamide to NAD+ to give NADH.  \nOverall then the Pyruvate DH Complex converts pyruvate into acetyl CoA in a physiologically irreversible reaction with the release of carbon dioxide and the capture of an electron pair as a hydride ion on NADH.

This is accomplished through the Glycogen Cascade Control system.  \nResponse begins with a hormonal signal, such as adrenalin, binding to the receptor on the cell surface. This results in the phosphorylation of GDP to GTP on an intracellular G-protein. The G-protein can now interact with Adenylate cyclase to produce the \"second messenger\" 3', 5'- cyclic AMP (cAMP). Cyclic AMP then binds to the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, releasing the active catalytic subunits (C), which can now phosphorylate inactive o-phosphorylase kinase b to the active m-phosphorylase kinase a (0= original, m= modified, b= inactive, a= active). Phosphorylase kinase a then phosphorylates o-Glycogen phosphorylase b to the active m-Glycogen phosphorylase a, resulting in the breakdown of glycogen with the release of G-lP.  \nNote the parallel kinase cascade which simultaneously shuts down Glycogen synthase.  \nFinally, one does not always have a warning, that is to get the endocrine system going to produce adrenalin, thus the release of Calcium in the muscle cells bypasses much of the cascade, activating normally inactive 0Phosphorylase kinase b , which then acts on both the phosphorylase and the synthase.",

This is accomplished through the Glycogen Cascade Control system.  \nResponse begins with a hormonal signal, such as adrenalin, binding to the receptor on the cell surface. This results in the phosphorylation of GDP to GTP on an intracellular G-protein. The G-protein can now interact with Adenylate cyclase to produce the \"second messenger\" 3', 5'- cyclic AMP (cAMP). Cyclic AMP then binds to the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, releasing the active catalytic subunits (C), which can now phosphorylate inactive o-phosphorylase kinase b to the active m-phosphorylase kinase a (0= original, m= modified, b= inactive, a= active). Phosphorylase kinase a then phosphorylates o-Glycogen phosphorylase b to the active m-Glycogen phosphorylase a, resulting in the breakdown of glycogen with the release of G-lP.  \nNote the parallel kinase cascade which simultaneously shuts down Glycogen synthase.  \nFinally, one does not always have a warning, that is to get the endocrine system going to produce adrenalin, thus the release of Calcium in the muscle cells bypasses much of the cascade, activating normally inactive 0Phosphorylase kinase b , which then acts on both the phosphorylase and the synthase."

This increases the charge gradient across the membrane, and thus must be driven by the mitochondrial proton gradient. Of course P, must also be transported across the membrane with ADP to make ATP in the matrix. This is accomplished using another transporter which co-transports a dihydrogen phosphate and a single proton in an electroneutral process.

Two situations occur.  \n- Short to medium length fatty acids are permeable to the mitochondrial membrane. They are activated to fatty acyl CoA derivatives in the mitochondrial matrix by Butyryl-CoA Synthetase:  \n<!-- image -->  \nNote that two ATP equivalents are required: the phosphoanhydride and thioester bonds are of similar free energies, so a second phosphoanhydride bond is also hydrolyzed to drive the reaction to completion.  \n- Long chain fatty acids are are bound to Fatty acid binding protein for transport within the cytosol. They are impermeable to the inner mitochondrial membrane. They are thus esterified in the cytosol by microsomal Fatty acyl CoA synthetase in a reaction identical to the one shown above. Again the reaction is driven by the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate. The enzyme involves an acyl AMP intermediate:  \n<!-- image -->  \nwith Ping Pang Bi Uni-Uni Bi kinetics:  \n<!-- image -->"

Carbamyl-P is itself a high-energy compound with a mixed anhydride bond much like we saw in l,3-bis PGA. The carbamyl group is then transferred onto ornithine which acts as a carrier for the growing urea molecule. Addition of the aspartate nitrogen requires two additional ATP equivalents to drive the condensation to argininosuccinate. Lysis results in the formation of a fumerate and arginine, which is then hydrolyzed to give our product, Urea, and regenerate the ornithine carrier (Fig 12.1).  \nFig. 12.1 : Urea Cycle  \n<!-- image -->  \n-  Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase I (CPS I): provides the substrate, carbamoyl phosphate, for the urea cycle.

This generates an extremely high reducing power in a tyrosine residue (called 'Z') of the Dl subunit of PSII, which pulls an electron out of water via a manganoprotein to replace that lost from the reaction centre. The water splitting reaction is often termed the Hill reaction."

C4 leaf veins show up as a darker green than the rest of the leaf: you can usually spot this just by holding a leaf upto the light.  \nC4 photosynthesis is found in both monocotyledons and dicotyledons. Most of the economically important ones are found in the Poaceae (grasses), and there are some interesting intermediates between C3 and C4, such as Panicum milioides. The genus Atriplex contains both C3 and C4 types which are still closely enough related to interbreed.  \nThe C4 syndrome was discovery when radioactive 14C02 was fed to sugarcane, and the first products seen were C4 acids, not C3 PGA.  \nThe receptor for C02 in C4 plants is not RuBP, but phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which is generally carboxylated by PEP carboxylase."

Useful for characterizing and/ or separating macromolecules.\n- Unidirectional replication. See bidirectional replication.\n- Unwinding proteins. Proteins that help to unwind double-stranded DNA during DNA replication.\n- Urea cycle. A metabolic pathway in the liver that leads to the synthesis of urea from amino groups and C02. The function of the pathway is to convert the ammonia resulting from catabolism to a nontoxic form, which is then secreted.\n- UV irradiation. Electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength shorter than that of visible light (200-390 nm). Causes damage to DNA (mainly by forming pyrimidine dimers)."
