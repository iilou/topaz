## FOREWORD

Biochemistry is a gateway of all the branches of life science. It's a field of enormous interest and utility. Biochemistry is a study of the molecule of life. Our understanding of the molecular nature of life is growing at an incredible rate. It is difficult to embody all the information related to this subject in a single collection. If at all it has been done than the user will be discouraged by its volume. It is than even more tough task to encapsulate huge bulk of literature in a small handy book. This effort is done by our team in the Department of Biochemistry, Junagadh Agricultural University, Junagadh, Gujarat, India.

The tools of biochemistry have been used to explain biological processes such as origin of life, cell development, cell differentiation, metapolisms, energy dynamics, origin and cause of diseases and even human behaviors. The principles of biochemistry are now reaching into chemistry, the health sciences, nutrition, agriculture, physiology, immunology, neurology, cell biology, biotechnology, nanotechnology, ecology, computer science and psychology. Not only the biochemistry expanding; other disciplines are using the tools of biochemistry to solve their unique problem. Thus biochemistry is seated at the core of other branches of science.

This particular branch is engaged in understanding the nature and properties of the life throbbing around us. It is at the threshold where non living biomolecules through some intricate forces starts dancing while getting alive; and we call it a living being. This science has yet to fill up a knowledge gap about secret of life itself.

This text book is a distillation of the years of experiences of our faculty members affiliated with teaching and research. Hopefully a complete grasp of the principle of biochemistry can be obtained by simply reading this book. This collection entitled FUNDAMENTALS OF BIOCHEMISTRY: A TEXTBOOK will cater the need of a large segment of people who have a scientific bend.

## PREFACE

As such the subject of Biochemistry is vast in its content. Its a tough task to packup it in a single volume. While preparing a brief note of this subject our faculty members worked for more than 12 hours in a day behind each and every chapter even at final stage. They summarized the content without loosing the essense of the concept. I found it beautifully narrated with 145 figures &amp; photographs, 30 tables containing total 322 text pages.

While reading any subject our mind do summarize its major points. This book has been able to develop as a ready reckoner. Its my pleasure that our faculty mambers are mastering the art of scientific writing. There is vacume in the area of lucid and lucrative scientific documentation. If we want to propagate the scientific knowledge we should present it in a more simple form, in a pictorial and diagrammatic manner. It should be more graphical and photographica1. I think our team working at the Biochemistry and Biotechnology Department of Junagadh Agricultural University has to some extent fulfilled the above contention while preparing this book entitled "FUNDAMENTALS OF BIOCHEMISTRY: A TEXTBOOK" . .

I have no doubt that this collection will be appreciated by the students, teachers, researchers and professionals dealing with biosciences.

## Chapter 1

## Introduction

Biochemistry is the chemistry of living organisms. It bridges the gap between the conventional chemistry and biology. Living organisms have certain extraordinary properties. They can grow, respond to stimuli and replicate themselves with high fidelity. All these activities are ultimately interpretable in chemical terms. The lifeless organic molecules with appropriate complexity and properties make a living thing. The basic phenomena of biochemistry is to understand how the collections of inanimate molecules that constitute living organisms interact with each other to maintain life. The basic life processes or chemistry remains broadly the same whether it is an unicellular microorganism or the higher organisms such as human or plants. Life is nothing but thousands of ordered chemical reactions. In other words, chemistry is the logic of all biological phenomena.

## Origin of Life

What is life? This is not as easy to define as we might like! Life has several properties, none of which are unique or defining, but which together contribute to our understanding of living thing. Life is:

- Improbable (by the 2 nd law of thermodynamics).
- Data (DNA is a ternary code).
- Metabolism (complex, autocatalytic biochemistry).
- Replication (self-copying, with heredity).

So when does the first evidence of improbable, information-containing, metabolic replication occur in the fossil record? The Earth is 4,500 million years old, as judged by several corroborating radionuclide studies of the oldest rocks on the planet show. Meteoric bombardment of the proto-Earth continued heavily until 4,000 MY A, probably precluding life during this period. The majority of the oldest rocks on Earth are 3,500 million years old, and the earliest microfossils are from 3,000+ MYA, hence we only have a window of about 500 million years from the end of the meteoric bombardment to the first signs of microbial life. This means we are either very lucky, or life is a high-on certainty!

What did life use as its raw materials? Early theories of life's origins thought that the earth had a reducing atmosphere (i.e., lots of ammonia and methane) but this

## FUlldamentals of Biochelllistnj : A Textbook

seems less likely now, as our understanding of early Earth chemistry has proceeded. An oxidizing atmosphere (oxygen) came very much later as evidenced by absence of rust in earliest rocks (the cyanobacteria were responsible for this bit of environmental vandalism), and it's likely that the original atmosphere of Earth was very dull and fairly neutral (nitrogen, carbon dioxide). This is one of the reasons that hydrothermal vents have become popular: life involves highly reduced carbon compounds, and the only places reducing agents are in abiotic abundance are in places like vents where gases escape from the Earth's mantle. In addition to the contributions from the atmosphere (or lack thereof), meteoric waste (amino acids, water-ice, cyanide, polyaromatics) and hydrothermal-associated chemicals (hydrogen sulphide, carbon monoxide, cyanide, pyrite) may have contributed to the alleged 'soup' from which life evolved.

When discussing the first organisms, we should distinguish between the most recent common ancestor of life (which may, or may not, have been Archaea-like) and the first forms of life. These may not necessarily be the same thing: imagine all life but mammals were wiped out. VVe might start invoking something shrewlike as the first organism, but this is clearly ridiculous. Similarly, DNA/ prorein creatures may just be lucky survivors from a far more diverse group of proto-life. However, bearing this in mind, it can be noted that the Archaea (those weirdarse bacteria that live in boiling sulphuric acids, etc.) are sulfur metabolisers and hyperthermophiles, supporting a hydrothermal origin, if indeed these features in Archaea are 'primitive', of which we have no guarantee.

The formation of polymers is more problematic. A major difficulty is that biopolymers are all thermodynamically unstable relative to their hydrolysis products. Some theories, but no certainty as to how polymers may have formed, though polymers have been synthesized under conditions which may have occurred on the early Earth.

The biggest problem for the origin of life is the issue of how we go from polymers to living "systems."

- Consider the probelm of protein biosynthesis:
- o Going from DNA (information archive) to RNA (usable information) requires a rather complex system to assure accurate transcription today. However, we could assume a much simpler system in the early, low-competition, Earth.
- o Going from RNA to protein incredibly complex:

## Introduction

- Need adaptor molecules (t-RNA) because there isn1t any natural relationship between RNA codes (sequences) and particular amino acids.
- Need enzymes to match specific amino acids to specific tRNNs because even the tRNNs are not specific to amino acids in term of recognizing them.
- as a result, need 20 tRNAs + 20 proteins!
- Need a complex molecular machine, the Ribosome, to read off the mRNA message using the tRNAs and make proteins:
- Ribosome consists of
- 1-2 small RNAs + two large, complexly folded, RNAs,
- 50-100 accessory proteins.
- o The chance of such a system arising spontaneously is truly infini tesimal.
- 11RNA World 11 has been postulated to solve these dificulties.
- o In this scenario RNA-based life preceeds 11modern 11 life.
- o First 11 life 11 combined information and catalytic properties in Single RNA-protein molecules.
- o Later there was a transition where proteins took over much of machinery over time.

## The Elements of Life

The basic requirements of an idealized living thing is Simplest life form and ask why life should use the particular atoms and molecules dominating in a particular living organisms.

The follOWing observations may be made regarding the elements of life:

Life is Largely a Phenomena of Hydrogen and the Second Period of the Periodic Table. The major component elements are C, H, 0, N in all known organisms are from these periods.

- First, It was observed that C, H, 0 and N are the smallest elements capable of forming 1, 2, 3, and 4 bonds, respectively. Smallest is important because that means they can form the strongest most stable covalent bonds. So these atoms are going to be capable of forming some of the most stable molecules, an important consideration for something that needs to grow and reproduce in a hostile environment.
- o C is particularly noteworthy because it forms strong, stable bonds with itself. As a result it can form the backbone of large chain and branched structures, a unique character among the elements.
- Second, C, N, and 0 are also the only elements capable of forming strong multiple bonds (carbon and nitrogen can form triple bonds, all three can form double bonds).

The Next Important Elements to Life Occur in Period 3: P and S are the smallest elements capable of multiple covalent bonds to C, 0 and N, and which also have available d-shells. The d-shells allow additional transition states and reaction mechanisms. P and S are particularly important in the capture, storage, and distribution of chemical energy.

Conveniently these elements are among the most abundant in the Universe. None-the-Iess, these elements were chosen for their special properties, specifically strong covalent bond formation (to enable the formation of stable biomolecules), the ability of carbon to form large branched molecules, and for C, N, and 0 the formation of multiple bonds which provides chemical flexibility (step-wise oxidations, different hybridization geometries etc.).

- The "essential" elemental ions found in all studied species, Ca (+2), Mg (+2), K (+1), Na (+1) and Cl (-1) were probably chosen more on the basis of availability in the primordial oceans than for any specific properties: other ions are very similar.
- The trace elements required by all studied organisms, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, and Zn, are all used as co-catalysts and/or ligands. Thus they were probably chosen for their specific redox properties and/ or electronic structures as well as their availability on the early earth.
- . A variety of other elements are required by atleast a few organisms, and These are B, F, AI, Ti, V, Cr, Ni, Ga, As, Se, Br, Mo, Sn and I. The elements like He, Li, Be, Ne, Ar, Sc, Ge, Kr are not known to be of biological

importance, but are shown as "place-markers" to help us keep track on the Table.

## Biomolecules to Cells

There are a few critically important small molecular precursors to biomolecules found in the environment. Biomolecules can be looked at in two major categories: small molecules and macromolecules.

The small molecules are going to be either metabolites or monomers from which the macromolecules are built.

First let's note the "inorganic" (sometimes called mineral) molecules and molecular ions: oxygen (02), water (H20)' carbon dioxide (C02), ammonia or ammonium ion (NH3 or NH4+), nitrate ion (N03-), nitrogen (N2), phosphate ion (P043-) and sulphate ion (5042-). These are mostly metabolites, though the ions can also serve as counter ions along with chloride in creating the intracellular media.

These molecules and ions In turn can be made into metabolites, small organic molecules used in energy transformation and as precursors to monomers and macromolecules.

The monomers and the associated macromolecules are divided into four major categories:

1. The nitrogenous bases (purines and pyrimidines) which are components of the nucleic acids (RNA and DNA-used for information storage and processing)

Both purines and pyrimidines are linked to a sugar, ribose or deoxyribose, and phosphate in their active, nucleotide, forms, as in ATP, below:

2. The amino acids.

Amino acids are components of proteins, which comprise the machinery of life [enzymes] and much of the structure of life-proteins are the molecules that do things.

3. The sugars, which are components of the polysaccharides (together comprising the carbohydrates, which are used for energy storage and structure). Glucose, the most common sugar, is shown in a cyclic form. Note that a sugar must have an aldehyde or ketone and two or more alcohol functional groups by definition.
4. The fatty acids which, together with glycerol, make up the fats (used mostly for energy storage) and the phospholipids (the major component of cell membranes). The 16 carbon fatty acid palmitate is shown below:

A typical phospholipid is shown here, replacement of the phosphate ester group with a third fatty acid would give a fat instead:

## Introduction

The amino acids, nucleotides, and sugars can all be polymerized to give the macromolecules characteristic of life: proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides, respectively. Briefly, proteins comprise the machinery and much of the structure of life; nucleic acids provide the information required to specify the proteins, and polysaccharides pl \_vide structural fibers and energy storage molecules.

Note that all of these families of molecules exhibit chirality's in some, and generally most, of their members. Also, biological systems chose a single chirality for each family (e.g., L-amino acids, D-sugars)

All of these molecules together go to make up cells.

## Cells and Organelles

There are two main cell types: prokaryote and eukaryote.

## Prokaryote Cell

The structure of a prokaryote is very much simpler than that of a eukaryote. There are no endomembranes, endosymbionts, nucleus or cytoskeleton. The DNA is carried on the genophore, a circular chromosome, in a ill defined area of the cytosol called the nucleoid. The chromosome is attached to the cell membrane during cell division (fission), frequently at a point called the mesosome.

- pro-karyon - before kernel.
- No nucleus -free circular genophore.
- 'Simple' rotating motor-type flagellum.
- Cell division by fission, genophore attached to plasmalemma by mesosome.
- Few membrane-bound organelles, no double-membrane bound organelles.
- They are 'small' because diffusion limits the rate of transport across the cell-lllm.

Bacteria are prokaryotes, lacking well-defined nuclei and membrane-bound organelles, (Fig. 1.1) and with chromosomes composed of a Single closed DNA circle. They come in many shapes and sizes, from minute spheres, cylinders and spiral threads, to flagellated rods, and filamentous chains. They are found practically everywhere on Earth and live in some of the most unusual and seemingly inhospitable places.

Evidence shows that bacteria were in existence as long as 3.5 billion years ago, making them one of the oldest living organisms on the Earth. Even older than the bacteria are the archeans (also called tiny prokaryotic organisms that live only in extreme environments: boiling water, super-salty pools, sulphur-spewing volcanic vents, acidic water, and deep in the Antarctic ice. Many scientists now believe that the archaea and bacteria developed separately from a common ancestor nearly four billion years ago. Millions of years later, the ancestors of today'S eukaryotes split off from the archaea. Despite the superficial resemblance to bacteria, biochemically and genetically, the archea are as different from bacteria as bacteria are from humans.

In the late 1600s, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek became the first to study bacteria under the microscope. During the nineteenth century, the French scientist Louis Pasteur and the German physiCian Robert Koch demonstrated the role of bacteria as pathogens (causing disease). The twentieth century saw numerous advances in bacteriology, indicating their diversity, ancient lineage, and general importance. Most notably, a number of scientists around the world made contributions to the field of microbial ecology, showing that bacteria were essential to food webs and for the overall health of the Earth's ecosystems. The discovery that some bacteria produced compounds lethal to other bacteria led to the development of antibiotics, which revolutionized the field of medicine.

There are two different ways of grouping bacteria. They can be divided into three types based on their response to gaseous oxygen. Aerobic bacteria require oxygen for their health and existence and will die without it. Anerobic bacteria can't tolerate gaseous oxygen at all and die when exposed to it. Facultative

aneraobes prefer oxygen, but can live without it.

The second way of grouping them is by how they obtain their energy. Bacteria that have to consume and break down complex organic compounds are heterotrophs. This includes species that are found in decaying material as well as those that utilize fermentation or respiration. Bacteria that create their own energy, fueled by light or through chemical reactions, are autotrophs.

Capsule Some species of bacteria have a third protective covering, a capsule made up of polysaccharides (complex

carbohydrates). Capsules play a number of roles, but the most important are to keep the bacterium from drying out and to protect it from phagocytosis (engulfing) by larger microorganisms. The capsule is a major virulence factor in the major disease-causing bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Nonencapsulated mutants of these organisms are avirulent, i.e., they don't cause disease.

Cell Envelope - The cell envelope is made up of two to three layers: the interior cytoplasmic membrane, the cell wall, and -in some species of bacteria -an outer capsule.

Cell Wall -Each bacterium is enclosed by a rigid cell wall composed of peptidoglycan, a protein-sugar (polysaccharide) molecule. The wall gives the cell its shape and surrounds the cytoplasmic membrane, protecting it from the environment. It also helps to anchor appendages like the pili and flagella, which originate in the cytoplasm membrane and protrude through the wall to the outside. The strength of the wall is responsible for keePiif'S the cell from bursting when there are large differences in osmotic pressure between the cytoplasm and the environment.

Cell wall composition varies widely amongst bacteria and is one of the most important factors in bacterial species analysis and differentiation. For example, a relatively thick, meshlike structure that makes it possible to distinguish two basic types of bacteria. A technique devised by Danish physician Hans Christian Gram in 1884, uses a staining and washing technique to differentiate between the two forms. When exposed to a gram stain, gram-positive bacteria retain the purple colour of the stain because the structure of their cell walls traps the dye. In gram-negative bacteria, the cell wall is thin and releases the dye readily when washed with an alcohol or acetone solution.

,Cytoplasm The cytoplasm, or protoplasm, of bacterial cells is where the functions for cell growth, metabolism, and replication are carried out. It is a gellike matrix composed of water, enzymes, nutrients, wastes, and gases and contains cell structures such as ribosomes, a chromosome, and plasmids. The cell envelope encases the cytoplasm and all its components. Unlike the eukaryotic (true) cells, bacteria do not have a membrane enclosed nucleus. The chromosome, a single, continuous strand of DNA, is localized, but not contained, in a region of the cell called the nucleoid. All the other cellular components are scattered throughout the cytoplasm.

Cytoplasmic Membrane - A layer of phospholipids and proteins, called the cytoplasmic membrane, encloses the interior of the bacterium, regulating the flow of materials in and out of the cell. This is a structural trait bacteria share

with all other living cells; a barrier that allows them to selectively interact with their environment. Membranes are highly organized and asymmetric having two sides, each side with a different surface and different functions. Membranes are also dynamic, constantly adapting to different conditions.

One of those component'), plasmids, are small, extrachromosomal genetic structures carried by many strains of bacteria. Like the chromosome, plasmids are made of a circular piece of DNA. Unlike the chromosome, they are not involved in reproduction. Only the chromosome has the genetic instructions for initiating and carrying out cell division, or binary fission, the primary means of reproduction in bacteria. Plasmids replicate independently of the chromosome and, while not essential for survival, appear to give bacteria a selective advantage.

Plasmids are passed on to other bacteria through two means. For most plasmid types, mpies in the cytoplasm are passed on to daughter cells during binary fission. Other types of plasmids, however, form a tubelike structure at the surface called a pilus that passes copies of the plasmid to other bacteria during conjugation, a process by which bacteria exchange genetic information. Plasmids have been shown to be instrumental in the transmission of special properties, such as antibiotic drug resistance, resistance to heavy metals, and virulence factors necessary for infection of animal or plant hosts. The ability to insert specific genes into plasmids have made them extremely useful tools in the fields of molecular biology and genetics, specifically in the area of genetic engineering.

Flagella Flagella (singular, flagellum) are hairlike structures that provide a means of locomotion for those bacteria that have them. They can be found at either or both ends of a bacterium or all over its surface. The flagella beat in a propeller-like motion to help the bacterium move toward nutrients; away from toxic chemicals; or, in the case of the photosynthetic cyanobacteria; toward the light.

Nucleoid -The nucleoid is a region of cytoplasm where the chromosomal DNA is located. It is not a membrane bound nucleus, but simply an area of the cytoplasm where the strands of DNA are found. Most bacteria have a single, circular chromosome that is responsible for replication, although a few species do have two or more. Smaller circular auxiliary DNA 'strands, called plasmids, are also found in 'the cytoplasm.

Pili -Many species of bacteria have pili (singular, pilus), small hairlike projections emerging from the outside cell surface. These outgrowths assist the bacteria in attaching to other cells and surfaces, such as teeth, intestines, and rocks. Without pili, many disease-causing bacteria loose their ability to infect

## Introduction

because they're unable to attach to host tissue. Specialized pili are used for conjugation, during which two bacteria exchange fragments of plasmid DNA.

Ribosomes -Ribosomes are microscopic "factories" found in all cells, including bacteria. They translate the genetic code from the molecular language of nucleic acid to that of amino acids --the building blocks of proteins. Proteins are the molecules that perform all the functions of cells and living organisms. Bacterial ribosomes are similar to those of eukaryotes, but are smaller and have a slightly different composition and molecular structure. Bacterial ribosomes are never bound to other orga~elles as they sometimes are (bound to the endoplasmic reticulum) in eukaryotes, but are free-standing structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm. There are sufficient differences between bacterial ribosomes and eukaryotic ribosomes that some antibiotics will inhibit the functioning of bacterial ribosomes, but not a eukaryote's, thus killing bacteria but not the eukaryotic organisms they are infecting.

## Eukaryote Cell

The most characteristic feature of a eukaryotic cell, the nucleus, consists of a nucleoplasm surrounded by a double nuclear m"mbrane pierced by nuclear pores. The nucleoplasm contains the (linear) chromosomes of the cell, which are organised into heterochromatin, which stains only a little, and euchromatin, which stains more densely. The most important euchromatic area is the· nucleolus, in which ribosomes are formed (Fig. 1.2).

- eu-karyon - true kernel.
- Double-membrane bound nucleus containing linear chromosomes.
- Complex 9+2-type undulipodium, cytoskeleton, cytosis and mitosis.
- Many membrane-bound organelles and double membrane-bound endosymbionts:

- They can grow 'large' because cytoplasmic streaming allows rapid transport across the cell-lOO Ilm.

## The role of the nucleus is three-fold:

- Storage and protection of the genome.
- Regulation of gene expression.
- Creation of ribosomes.

DNA storage takes up about 10% of the cell of both prokaryotes (nucleoid area) and eukaryotes (nucleus). However, don't forget that some of the genome lives elsewhere: plasmids, endosymbionts (mitochondria), etc. The nucleus of eukaryotes also protects the genome from the cytoskeleton. Condensation of genome during mitosis is required to withstand these stresses. This is not relevant in prokaryotes, as they lack a cytoskeleton. The existence of the nucleus permits processing of mRNA, and therefore defers translation. Alternative splicing can be performed to generate different proteins from the same RNA primary transcript. mRNA is capped and tailed to permit it to exit the nucleus. rRNA and tRNA are also heavily processed by RNA editing, i.e., base modification (this also occurs to some mRNA in trypanosomes). rRNA modification occurs in the nucleolus, where ribosomes are constructed.

## Introduction

The nucleus is bound by a double-membrane, which is contiguous through the nuclear pores, known as the nuclear envelope. The pores are required to allow RNA out and membrane lipids in (which is needed for growth during S phase).

The inner face of the inner nuclear envelope (INE) is coated by the nuclear lamina, which contains intermediate fibres called lamins A, Band C (atleast in mammals). Phosphorylation of lamins by kinases cause nuclear envelope breakdown during prometaphase. Chromosomes occupy definite positions within the nucleus because of the interaction between lamins and telomeres, for example the Rabl conformation in yeast.

The outer nuclear envelope (ONE) is surrounded by other intermediate fibres, and is essentially just the RER surrounding the nucleus, and continuous with it. The space between the INE and ONE is termed the perinuclear space, and is continuous with the RER cisternae.

The cell wall of eukaryotes (when present) is usually composed of a 4)glucan of some sort. In fungi, it is mostly chitin (N-acetylaminoglucan), in plants cellulose, but more exotic ingredients are common. Animal cells lack a wall, but may have a glycocalyx, which is a layer of thickened glycoproteins surrounding them and connecting them to the extracellular matrix.

Almost all eukaryotes have mitochondria, which are the remains of bacteria that became endosymbionts of the eukaryotic cell about a billion years ago. They perform oxidative phosphorylation and generate energy in the form of ATP for the cell. They have their own 70S ribosomes and some of their own DNA. Mitochondria have a double membrane surrounding them, the inner one is highly folded into cristae, surrounding a matrix space.

The fraction of eukaryotic ribosomes are as under -

- Large 60S subunit:
- o 28SrRNA,
- o 5SrRNA,
- o 5.8SrRNA,
- o 49 proteins.
- Small 30S subunit:
- o 18SrRNA,
- o 33 proteins.

Eukaryotic DNA is bound by histones, and requires some degree of unpacking for expression. Much of their genome is composed of parasitic DNA and introns. Three RNA polymerases exists, (approximately) one for each sort of major RNA product:

- RNApol-I - rRNA.
- RNApol-II - mRNA and snRNA.
- RNApol-III - tRNA and SS rRNA.

RNA is heavily processed in the nucleus, which allows deferred translation. They possess large 80S ribosomes. Organelles of Eukaryote and it's function are summarized in Table 1.1. However, relative volume of organelles of liver cells are given in Table 1.2.

## Water

Water is a very unusual, even incredible substance whose amazing properties are often unappreciated because of its ubiquitousness. Water's special properties include extremely high MP and BP (0 QC &amp; 100 QC K, compare to methane, -183 QC &amp; -161 QC, with a MW of 16 vs. water's 18); a high heat capacity (18 cal;oC mol vs. 8 cal;oC mol for methane); it has a high viscosity; its solid form is less dense than the liquid form at the same temperature (ice floats on water - very rare), it has a large surface tension, and it has a high dielectric constant (78.5 vs. 1.9 for hexane).

&lt;±)

## Introduction

The high MP, BP, and heat capacity of water all predict relatively strong bonding between water molecules, so letls first review the types of bonding which occur between atoms and molecules. The most stable bonds are of course covalent bonds (with bond energies of 50 [5-5] to 80 rC-Cl to 110 [O-H] kcaljmol), occurring when It has significantly overlap of atomic orbitals.

Water of course is a covalent structure: H-O-H. The special properties of water is -polarity of between O-H bonds and the resultant dipole moments of the bonds and the molecule itself.

<!-- image -->

The water molecule itself is bent, with an angle between the hydrogens (compare to 109.5° tetrahedron). of 104S for

Because of the very strong dipole moments of these bonds and the very, small size of the hydrogen substituents on water, a slight degree of orbital overlap occurs between adjacent water oxygens and hydrogens to give partial covalent bonds known as H-bonds (effectively, can only form with 0, N, &amp; F).

- Note that the partial covalent character means that they are directional! Compare the bond length of water H bonds (0.18 nm) to the covalent bond-length between 0 and H of 0.096 nm - notice that the bond distance is nearly twice the true covalent bond distance, but significantly less than the van der Waals radius of 0.26 nm.

In addition to covalent bonds and H-bonds there are a variety of non-covalent bonds/interactions as seen in the Table 1.4:

## Within solid bulk water (ice):

- Every water molecule is bonded to 4 others, as in the ice structure
- o In liquid water the molecules are still bonded to a large degree (the heat of fusion for ice is only 13% of the heat of vapourization for ice, thus most of the H-bonds must survive melting).
- o Of course in liquid water the bonds are very unstable (average lifetime about 10 psec = 1011 sec), exchanging constantly to give a "flickering cluster" structure.
- o The various properties of water arise from this structure. (Note high BP &amp; MP, heat cap., viscosity, and, less obviously, that ice floats.
- Ice floats because the molecules are in an open lattice rather than closepacked. Garrett and Grisham (in their text, Biochemistry, 2nd ed.) note that close-packed water molecules would only occupy about 57% of the volume of ice. This would lead one to expect that ice would float "high." It doesn't because most of the structure remains in the liquid phase at 0° C.)

Water is an Excellent Solvent for Polar Substances since its dipolar structure enables it to insulate them from each other and it can make good dipole-dipole and dipole-charge bonds. Anything which can H-bond will also of course be quite soluble.

## How does Water Interact with Non-Polar Molecules?

- The problem here is that in order to dissolve in water a non-polar molecule must disrupt a series of H-bonds and no new bonds of equal strength are substituted.
- Thus water tends to exclude non-polar substances. When we forcefully disperse a non-polar substance into water then the water must form a cage around the molecule to maximize H-bonds for each water molecule.
- o Now an additional problem arises-the waters hydrating the nonpolar group are "locked" in place they can't easily flip about because there is no interior bond for substitution!
- Thus the entropy of these water molecules is greatly reduced. So the insolubility of non-polar groups in water has both enthalpic and entropic factors!

## Ionization of Water, pH &amp; Buffers

Dissociation of Water Molecules: In normal aqueous solution, there is a certain probability that a hydrogen nucleus (a proton) can exchange between two hydrogen bonded molecules:

<!-- image -->

(Of course the hydronium ion, H30+, will be associated with additional water molecules as well through H-bonding\_ For simplicity we will just write H+, with the understanding that it refers infact to hydrated hydronium ions in aqueous solution\_ ) Note the reaction is not highly favoured, in neutral soluticn (no excess H+or OH-) there will only be 10-7 molar hydronium ions, in other words only about 2 of every billion water molecules will be protonated!

For aqueous solution [H+][OH-]= 10-14;

- pH = -log [H+]. Remember that a low pH means a high concentration of protons\_
- •
- pKa = -logKatherefore pH + pOH = 14, where pOH = -log[OH-]\_ The Bronsted definition for acids and bases: An acid is a proton donor, while a base is a proton acceptor\_ Recall the corollary that acids and bases therefore exist as conjugate acid base pairs\_ Note that when an acid by this definition gives up a proton it becomes a base,
- o since the reverse reaction would be accepting a proton:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Thus the acetic acid in the first reaction becomes its conjugate base acetate ion, while the base, hydroxide ion, becomes its conjugate acid, water. In the reverse reaction the nomenclature also reverses\_ Note that a molecule such as water can be both an acid, donating a proton to become its conjugate base hydroxide ion, or it can be a base, accepting a proton to become its conjugate acid, a hydronium ion\_

## pH &amp; Buffers

The strengths (ability to donate protons) of acids vary considerably\_

- For the general acid HA we can write:

Fundamentals ofBiochelllistnj : A Textbook

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Where Ka is the acid dissociation constant. (Note that the definition of Ka is based on the Br0nsted definition.) Values of Ka can vary tremendously (1015 to 10-60) - after all anything with at least one proton can be considered an acid under some circumstances with this definition. The common definition of a strong acid is an acid which dissociates completely in a 1 M solution. The common strong acids in aqueous solution, such as sulphuric, nitric and hydrochloric acids have Ka values (for the first dissociation in the case of sulfuric) of 102 to 109· Thus they all dissociate completely (first dissociation only for sulphuric) in aqueous solution, though they will have different strengths in some other solvents. Most common organic acids are weak in aqueous solution, having Ka values of 10-5 to 10-15 . Note that &lt; whether an acid is strong or weak is dependent on the solvent system! Strong acids have weak conjugate bases, and vice-versa.

- For reactions involving a strong acid or base we can assume, for practical purposes, that all of the strong acid or base added to a mixture will react until the base or acid originally present in solution is completely consumed. (Of course this is an approximation, all reactions actually approach an equilibrium condition, so that, in theory, there is always some reactant and some product present.) For example, if we start with a solution containing 0.100 mole of acetic acid and add 0.050 moles of sodium hydroxide the resulting mixture will contain 0.050 moles acetic acid, 0.050 moles sodium acetate and 0.000 moles sodium hydroxide (actually about 10-10 moles, which is 0.000 for our thousandths place significant figure calculation).

The equilibrium equation for a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base can be rewritten by taking logs of both sides and rearranging to give the HendersonHasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log [A-]j[HA]

## History of Biochemistry

Only during 17 th and 18th centuries, important foundations were laid in many fields of biology. The 19th century observed the development of very crucial concepts, which include the cell theory by Schleiden and Schwann, Mendel's study of inheritance and Darwin's theory of evolution. The real push to biochemistry was given in 1828 when total synthesis of urea from lead cyanate and ammonia was successfully achieved by Wohler who thus initiated the synthesis of organic compound from inorganic compound. Louis Pasteur,

## Introduction

during 1857, did a great deal of work on fermentations and pointed out categorically the central importance of enzymes in this process. The break through in enzyme research and hence, biochemistry was made in 1897 by Edward Buckner when he extracted enzyme from yeast cells in crude form which could ferment a sugar molecule into alcohol. Neuberg introduced the term biochemistry in 1903.

The early part of 20th century witnessed a sudden outburst of knowledge in chemical analysis, separation methods, electronic instrumentation for biological studies (X-ray diffraction, electron microscope, etc.) which ultimately resulted in understanding the structure and function of several key molecules involved in life processes such as proteins, enzymes, DNA and RNA.

In 1926, James Sumner established the protein nature of enzyme. He was responsible for the isolation and crystallization of urease, which provided a breakthrough in studies of the properties of specific enzymes.

The first metabolic pathway elucidated was the glycolytic pathway during the first half of the 20th century by Embden and Meyerhof. Otto Warburg, Cori and Parnas also made very important contributions relating to glycolytic pathway. Krebs established the citric acid and urea cycles during 1930-40. In 1940, Lipmann described the central role of ATP in biological systems.

The biochemistry of nucleic acids entered into a phase of exponential growth after the establishment of the structure of DNA in 1953 by Watson and Crick followed by the discovery of DNA polymerase by Kornberg in 1956. From 1960 onwards, biochemistry plunged into an interdisciplinary phase sharing much in common with biology and molecular genetics.

Frederick Sanger's contributions in the sequencing of protein in 1953 and nucleic acid in 1977 were responsible for further developments in the field of protein and nucleic acid research.

The growth of biochemistry and molecular biology was phenomenal during the past two decades. The development of recombinant DNA by Snell and coworkers during 1980 allowed for further growth and emergence of a new field, the genetic engineering.

Thus, there was progressive evolution of biology to biochemistry and then to molecular biology, genetic engineering and biotechnology. The chronological development of biochemistry and other related fields are given in Table 1.5.

## Nature and N omenc1ature

Carbohydrates are a large family of naturally occurring compounds including sugars, starches, and cellulose, as well as materials found in bacterial cell walls and insect exoskeletons. Carbohydrates, in general, contain a C-C skeletal monomers bearing C=O and OH (and sometimes NH2) functional groups. These skeletal monomers form polymers through a C-O-C linkage. Carbohydrates can also be called saccharides, a general word derived from the Latin word for sugar. The nomenclature of sugars uses the suffix, or word name ending, -ose to indicate a sugar e.g., : glucose.

The carbohydrates comprise one of the major groups of naturally occurring biomolecules. This is mainly because; the light energy from the sun is converted into chemical energy by plants through primary production and is transferred to sugars and carbohydrate derivatives. The dry substance of plants is composed of 50-80% of carbohydrates. The structural material in plants is mainly cellulose and hemicelluloses. Starch is the important form of storage polysaccharide in plants. Pectins and sugars such as sucrose and glucose are also plant constituents. Many non-carbohydrate organic molecules are found conjugated with sugars in the form of glycosides. The carbohydrates in animals are mostly found in combination with proteins as glycoproteins, as well as other compounds. The storage form of carbohydrates, glycogen, found in liver and muscles, the blood group substances, mucins, ground substance between cells in the form of mucopolysaccharides are few examples of carbohydrates playing important roles in animals. Chitin found in the exo-skeleton of lower animals, is a polymer of N-acetyl glucosamine. Carbohydrates are also universally found in other polymeric substances. For example, fats are fatty acid esters of a sugar alcohol, glycerol. Ribose and deoxyribose are constituent of nucleic acids. Moreover, in all living forms, the energy needed for mechanical work and chemical reactions are derived from carbohydrates. Adenosine triphosphate and related substances that contain ribose as a constituent are key substances in energy storage and transfer. The carbon skeletons of almost all organic molecules are derived from carbohydrates. Besides, the carbohydrates are the basic raw material of many important industries including sugar and sugar products,

## Classification of Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are classified into three major groups:

## Monosaccharides, Oligosaccharides and Polysaccharides

## Monosaccharides (Simple Sugars)

- Simplest form that cannot be hydrolyzed further into smaller units.
- Low molecular weight carbohydrates and cannot be hydrolysed further.
- Crystalline, soluble in water, and sweet in taste.
- Classified into triose, tetrose, pentose, hexose and heptose depending upon the number of carbon atoms. They may be either aldoses or ketoses depending upon whether they contain a (potential) free aldehyde (OH) or ketone (C=O) group, respectively.
- All monosaccharides are reducing in nature.

## Oligosaccharides

- Contain 2-10 monosaccharides joined by glycosidic bonds. Low molecular weight carbohydrates which can be hydrolysed by enzymes or acids to yield monosaccharides.
- Powdery or crystalline, soluble in water and sweet in taste.
- Classified into disaccharide, trisaccharide, tetrasaccharide and pentasaccharide depending upon the number of monosaccharides they contain.
- Some of them are reducing and some of them are non reducing in nature Polysaccharides (Glycans)
- Contain many monosaccharides joined by glycosidic bonds. They can be hydrolysed by enzymes or acids.
- Insoluble in water, tasteless, linear or branched.
- Classified into homoglycans and heteroglycans depending upon the kind of monosaccharides present. Depending upon the function, they are classified as storage and structural polysaccharides.
- Non reducing in nature.

## Monosaccharides

Monosaccharides are the building blocks of larger sugars, and their biochemistry is possibly the most complex and confusing of all the biochemicals. Here is a brief list of the key terms in monosaccharide nomenclature for glucose:

OH

<!-- image -->

- Number of carbons: six, hence hexose.
- Numbering of carbons: Cl is the carbonyl carbon, C6 the farthest carbon from this.
- Type of carbonyl compound: terminal CHO (aldehyde) hence aldose.
- DjL descriptor: the OH is to the right on the farthest chiral carbon from the CHO group (i.e., C5) in the Fischer projection, and in the Haworth projection, hence D-glucose.
- Names of sugars: the three intermediate chiral carbons (C2, C3, C4) indicate that this is glucose.
- Ring forms: six membered ring with anomeric OH (Cl) on same side as CH20H group (C5 and C6), hence a-pyranose.

The number of carbons in a sugar determines which size group of sugars it belongs to:

- 3 Carbons: triose - e.g., Glyceraldehydes, Dihidroxiacetone

- 4 Carbons: tetrose - e.g., Erythrose, Erythrulose, Threose

- 5 Carbons: pentose - e.g., Ribose, Ribulose, Xylose, Xylulose

- 6 Carbons: hexose - e.g., Glucose, Galactose, Fructose, Mannose, Sorbose

- 7 Carbons: heptulose - e,g., Sedoheptulose

Open chain monosaccharides (like the Fischer projection above) have n-2 chiral carbons, so 2n -2 isomers (assuming no internal symmetry). Note that sugars can also react internally to produce a variety of rings forms: this introduces an extra chiral centre, as you can see in the Haworth projection above.

These are a hexose and a triose.

The number in the chcim was given from the CHO group at the top down to the CH 2 0H group a base (i.e., number from the end nearest the carbonyl group). This way of drawing monosaccharides is called a Fischer projection: imagine the vertical bonds curling away from you and the horizontal bonds sticking out at you, like the back of a stegosaurus.

## Interpreting Fischer projections.

The type of carbonyl group present in a sugar is an important determinant of its chemical properties. Sugars with a terminal CHO group are chemically aldehydes, and are termed aldoses e.g., glyceraldehyde. These sugars are 'reducing sugars': they reduce the blue Cu 2 + in Benedict's solution to a red precipitate of Cu+. This is the test for reducing sugars so beloved of A-level syllabi. Sugars with an internal CO group, R-CO-R are ketones, and are called ketoses e.g., dihydroxyacetone (DHA). Although ketones are not generally reducing agents, the OH attached to the next carbon along is capable of reducing Benedict's reagent, hence all monosaccharides are 'reducing sugars'.

Dihydroxyacetone

D-glyceraldehyde

Sugars have a somewhat arcane nomenclature. So far it has been mostly logical, but from now on, it's largely arbitrary decisions made fifty years ago or more. Apologies for this.

Sugars contain many chiral centres. Naming these chirals centres should be easy Gust use R or S descriptors), but in fact, there are three systems for different bits of the sugar molecule. The first descriptor is used to name the chiral carbon farthest from the carbonyl group. This is called the OIL descriptor. If you draw sugar in the Fischer projection (as above), an OH to the right on the farthest chiral carbon is the O-form, and an OH to the left is the L-form. 0glyceraldehyde appears above. Note that OHA is nonchiral (it's about the only sugar that is!). The two forms of glucose are below, note that they differ at every chiral centre:

0H

The O-isomer of glyceraldehyde also happens to be the R isomer using CIP rules, as you can see from the following diagram.

<!-- image -->

It also happens to be the (+) isomer from polarimetry. This is easy to remember (R, D and +), but only by fluke! The remaining chiral centres in an open chain monosaccharide get 'proper' names. These are the D-forms of the common monosaccharides. Note that they differ only at carbons 2, 3 and 4.

## Aldoses

<!-- image -->

D-galactose and D-glucose differ at only one chiral centre: such a relationship makes them epimers.

## Ketoses

<!-- image -->

The third descriptor for monosaccharides only comes into play when sugars internally react to form rings. Monosaccharides react internally by nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl group by a OH group, to form a cyclical hemiacetal:.

<!-- image -->

Two chiral ring forms are possible, which introduces a new chiral center, so we now have (maximally) 2n -1 isomers. These diastereomers are called the a and 13 anomers. The a anomer has it's 'new' OH on the opposite side of the molecule to the CH20H group. The 13 anomer has it on the same side, as you can see below.

For glucose solutions, typically, the ratios of forms are 36% a, 63% 13, &lt;1 % open chain. When you dissolve glucose in water, the slow conversion of the solid equilibrium mix.ture to the aqueous equilibrium mixture means that the rotation glucose causes to polarised light decreases (becomes less positive) over time. This is called mutarotation.

A final complication for the ring forms is that the rings of hexoses and pentoses can be either 5 or 6 membered (including the heterocyclic oxygen atom), depending on which carbon (usually 4 or 5) the CO group is attacked by. Five membered rings are called furanoses, after the chemical furan. Six membered rings are called pyranoses, after pyran. These are glucopyranose and glucofuranose.

The Haworth notation has been used above to show the relative positions of the OH groups in the ring form. Haworth rotation is a simple and tidy way of representing ring forms, and is fairly self explanatory. Sugars actually take up cyclohexane shapes in the pyranose form, as shown below for glucose, but Haworth notation is considerably easier to interpret.

<!-- image -->

To convert between Haworth and Fischer projections is a little tricky. Remember that the Fischer projection curves away from you, with the OH and H groups sticking out like the plates on a stegosaur's back. If you turn the Fischer projection clockwise through 90° in your mind's eye, you will see that for carbons 2, 3, and 4, if the Fischer OH goes right, the Haworth OH goes down. Carbon 1 is the anomeric carbon, and doesn't exist in the open chain form, so we're left with carbon 5 to understand. You need to realise there is free rotation of the H, OH and CH20H groups around carbon-5, hence you can twirl the three groups round so that the CH20H is pointing up as you curl the chain round into a ring.

## Occurrence

- Intermediary metabolities in glucose metabolism.
- Ribose is a constituent of nucleic acid.
- Occurs in polysaccharides.
- Gum arabic, cherry gums, wood gums, proteoglycans.
- Fruit juices and cane sugar.
- Lactose, constituent of lipids.
- Plant mannosans and glycoproteins.
- Intermediate in carbohydrate metabolism.

## Derived Sugars / Sugar Derivatives

The important functional groups present in monosaccharides are hydroxyl and carbonyl groups. The hydroxyl group forms esters, usually with phosphoric acid or is replaced by a hydrogen or amino group. The carbonyl group undergoes reduction or oxidation to produce number of derived monosaccharides.

## Deoxy Sugars

In sugars, the hydroxyl group is replaced by a hydrogen to produce deoxy sugars (devoid of oxygen). The important deoxy sugar is 2-deoxy ribose that occurs in deoxy ribonucleic acid. Other important deoxy sugars are L-fucose and L. rhamnose.

The substitution of the hydroxyl group at C-6 of L. galactose or L.mannose with hydrogen produces fucose or rhamnose respectively. L-fucose occurs in the cell wall polysaccharides namely hemicelluloses and L-rhamnose occurs in pectic polysaccharides namely rhamnogalacturonan. These deoxy sugars are also found in the complex oligosaccharide components of glycoproteins and glycolipids.

## Amino Sugars

The hydroxyl group, usually at C-2, is replaced by an amino group to produce amino sugars such as glucosamine, galactosamine and mannosamine. The amino group may. be condensed with acetic acid to produce N-acetyl amino sugars, for example, N-acetyl glucosamine. This glucosamine derivative is important constituent of many structural polymers (chi tin, bacterial cell wall polysaccharides etc.).

## Polyols (alditols)

Both aldoses and ketoses are reduced to polyhydric a1cohols (polyols) when treated with enzymes, sodium amalgam, and hydrogen under high pressure

## Carbohydrates

with catalyst or sodium borohydride. Each aldose yields the corresponding alcohol upon reduction while a ketose forms two alcohols because of the appearance of a new asymmetric carbon atom in the process. By this reduction process, the following sugars give rise to their respective alcohols under specified conditions.

| Glucose        | Sorbitol              |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| Fructose       | Sorbitol and mannitol |
| Mannose        | Mannitol              |
| Glyceraldehyde | Glycerol              |
| Erythrose      | Erythritol            |
| Ribose         | Ribitol               |
| Galactose      | Dulci tol             |

Polyols occur in many plant products. Sorbitol was first isolated from the berries of mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia). Commercially sorbitol is manufactured by the hydrogenation of glucose. Mannitol occurs in many terrestrial and marine plants. Potential food applications of polyols include confectionery products, bakery products, deserts, jams and marmalade. Sorbitol is an excellent moisture conditioner and is used in pharmaceutical preparations such as elixirs and syrups. Sorbitol, as a humectant in creams and lotions helps to stabilize the water content, providing better moisture control. The use of sorbitol or xylitol in toothpaste and mouthwashes is highly desirable.

## Oxidation Products

When aldoses are oxidized under proper conditions with different types of oxidizing agents, three t'jpes of acids are produced, namely aldonic acids, uronic acids and aldaric acids or saccharic acids. .

## Aldonic Acids

Oxidation of an aldose with bromine water at neutral pH converts the aldehyde group to a carboxyl group. Hydrobromous acid formed by the reaction of water with bromine acts as an oxidizing agent. Ketoses are not readily oxidized by bromine water. Aldoses are not only oxidized by bromine water but also by the alkaline iodine solution.

| 12 + 2 NaOH    | NaOI + Nal +H20   |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Glucose + NaOI | gluconic acid     |

## Uronic Acids

vVhen aldoses are oxidised with hydrogen peroxide (H202) uronic acids are formed. In this reaction only primary alcohol group is oxidized to carboxyl

group, whereas the aldehyde group remains unchanged. Uronic acids are constituents of pectic polysaccharides.

## Aldaric or Saccharic Acid

When aldoses are oxidised with nitric acid, saccharic acids are formed. Both aldehyde and primary alcohol groups are oxidised to carboxyl groups. Glucose on oxidation with nitric acid produces glucaric or glucosaccharic acid. The aldaric acid produced from galactose is called as mucic acid.

## Oligosaccharides

The general term oligosaccharide, is often used for carbohydrates that contain from four to ten monosaccharide units. We will look at some of the common disaccharides, examine their bonding patterns and properties and then turn to some common polysaccharides.

The oligosaccharides commonly encountered in nature belong to disaccharides. The physiologically important disaccharides are maltose, lactose, trehalose and sucrose. Disaccharides consist of two monosaccharides joined covalently by an O-glycosidic bond. The hydroxyl group formed as a result of hemiacetal formation is highly reactive when compared to other hydroxyl groups. This

hydroxyl group present in one monosaccharide reacts with anyone of the hydroxyl groups attached to C-l, C-2, C-3, C-4, or C-6 of another monosaccharide to produce and linked disaccharides. When only one anomeric carbon is involved in glycosidic bond formation, reducing disaccharides are formed. If both anomeric carbon atoms of monosaccharides are involved in glycosidic bond formation that results in the formation of a non-reducing disaccharides such as trehalose (aldosyl-aldosyl disaccharide) or sucrose (aldosyl-ketosyl disaccharide)'. In the case of reducing disaccharides, one end of the molecule having free anomeric carbon is called reducing end and the other end, where the anomeric carbon is involved in glycosidic bond, is called as non-reducing end.

## Disaccharides (Table 2.2)

Glycosidic bonds - link sugars via acetal bonds

<!-- image -->

There are four common disaccharides :

- Maltose [a-D-Glucopyranosyl-(1,4)-a-D-glucopyranose]
- Cellobiose [p-D-Glucopyranosyl-(1,4)-P-D-glucopyranose]

<!-- image -->

Both maltose and cellobiose are composed of two D-glucose molecules linked together, the only difference between the two disaccharide is the nature of the 1, 4 glucosidic linkage.

- Lactose [p-D-Galactopyranosyl-(1,4)-P-D-glucopyranose] -

<!-- image -->

The major sugar found in human and cow's milk (4 to 8% lactose by weight).

In humans, the enzyme in the small intestine responsible for the hydrolysis of the (1, 4) glycosidic bond is called lactase. This enzyme is not present in all persons, particularly those whose ancestors did not rely upon cow's milk (and milk products) as a food source.

An exception for mammals is the ability of nursing animals to digest lactose. This ability is generaly lost at the age of weaning, at which time the animal becomes lactose intolerant.

A deficiency in the enzyme lactase give rise to: lactose intolerance, and this disorder occurs most commonly among Afro-Americans, Asians, Native Americans and Hispanics.

- Sucrose

<!-- image -->

The most common sugar in our diet is sucrose, which is a disaccharide.

It is composed of two monosaccharides a-D-glucose (a -D-glucopyranose) and b -D-fructose -D-fructofuranose).

Sucrose is unusual in that both monosaccharides are linked as acetals

Because both of the potential carbonyl groups in sucrose are tied up in acetals, sucrose shows none of the typical reactions of carbonyl compounds. It will not show positive Tollens test, cannot mutarotate, etc.

Sucrose can also be called: or fructofuranosyl-a -D-glucopyranoside.

Sucrose is an optically active molecule, [a]D = +66 0 but its optical activity is quite different from the sum of the optical activities of the two simple sugars, glucose and fructose. In fact an equimolar solution of glucose and fructose rotates light in

the opposite direction to the equivalent solution of sucrose. Glucose also rotates the plane of polarization to the right, so that it was once known as dextrose: [a]D = +52.5 0 for the equilibrium mixture of a and b. By contrast fructose rotates the plane of polarization to the left, so that it was once known as levulose: [a]D = 92.4 0 ·

The disachharides -maltose, lactose and cellobiose are reducing sugars, that is they have "free" aldehyde groups, whereas sucrose has both carbonyl groups tied up in the relatively stable glycosidic bond. In general, the -glycosidic bond is easily cleaved (it is less stable chemically and organisms have enzymes to cleave it) whereas the beta-glycosidic bond is very difficult to break down.

Thus for cellobiose, and more importantly, cellulose which is also linked by bonds, essentially only bacteria can digest this bond through cellulase enzyme.

So animals can't digest cellulose! Yes, they can digest through bacterial activity in their digestive system. Cows for instance are basically walking fermentation tanks.

## Polysaccharides

Polysaccharides are glycosides between sugars. The name given to the polysaccharide is dependent on the size of the molecule:

- 1 sugar unit: monosaccharide
- 2 sugar units: disaccharide
- 3 sugar units: trisaccharide
- 3-several sugar units: oligosaccharide
- 100+ sugar units: polysaccharide

POlysachharides are two types homo and heteropolysaccharides. Homopolysaccharides have a single type of residue. Most common polysaccharides contain glucose which is used for energy (food), storage (starches and glycogen) and structure (cellulose).

## Storage Polysaccharides

Starch (energy storage in plants). Two kinds

- Amylose: linear, a-l,4 glycosidic links. MW: 4,000-150,000. Deep blue col or with iodine due to coiled complex enclosing iodine-colour is lost with heating, returns when cooled.
- Amylopectin: branched every 30 or 50 units linear a-l,4 chain of 30 glu residues then a-l,6 branch point. Of course get branches on branches as well. MW: -&gt;500,000. Broken down by -amylase (pancreas and salivary glands; random cleavage of a-l,4 links) to give glucose and maltose; or

beta-amylase (plants; hydrolyses from reducing ends to give maltose). When either of these enzymes attack amylopectin, they are blocked when they reach or are near a branch, thus end up with a "limit dextrin."

<!-- image -->

Starches are carbohydrates in which 300 to 1000 glucose units join together. It is a polysaccharide which plants use to store energy for later use. Starch forms in grains with an insoluble outer layer which remain in the cell where it is formed until the energy is needed. Then it can be broken down into soluble glucose units. Starches are smaller than cellulose units, and can be more readily used for energy. In animals, the equivalent of starches is glycogen, which can be stored in the muscles or in the liver for later use.

<!-- image -->

Foods such as potatoes, rice, corn and wheat contain starch granules which are important energy sources for humans. The human digestive process breaks down the starches into glucose units with the aid of enzymes, and those glucose molecules can circulate in the blood stream as an energy source. An interesting example of this enzyme-catalyzed breakdown process is if you chew on a piece

of bread for a while, it will begin to taste sweet because the enzymes in saliva are already beginning to break down the starch into glucose, a sugar.

## Inulin

Inulin is a non-digestible fructosyl oligosaccharide found naturally in more than 36000 types of plants. It is a storage polysaccharide found in onion, garlic, chicory, artichoke, asparagus, banana, wheat and rye. It consists of mainly, if not exclusively, of (3fructosyl-fructose links. A starting glucose moiety can be present, but is not necessary. Inulin is a soluble fibre that helps maintain normal bowel function,decreases constipation, lowers cholesrerol and triglycerides. It is used for fat replacement a fibre enrichment in processed foods.

Glycogen: animal starch. Just like amylopectin, but more highly branched (every 8-12 residues). This allows more free ends for more rapid breakdown-important in animals.

## Structural Polysaccharides

## Cellulose:

Cellulose is the most abundant organic substance found in nature. It is a linear polymer of glucose, with 500 -5000 glucose units linked together to give molecules of molecular weight 100,000 to 1,000,000. It is the principal constituent of cell walls in higher plants. It occurs in almost pure form (98%) in cotton fibres and to a lessor extent in flax (80%), jute (60-70%), wood (40-50%) and cereal

- straws (30-43 % ).

linkages, thus resistant to breakdown (including acid hydrolysis) as required for structure (do not participate in digestion). Multiple, extended strands come together as fibrils held together with H-bonds, laid down in cell wall in criss-cross pattern, glued together with polyalcohols known as lignin.

Cellulose is a form of carbohydrate in which some 1500 glucose rings chain together. It is the chief constituent of cell walls in living organisms. Wood is mostly cellulose, making cellulose the most abundant type of organic compound on the Earth.

## Comparison of Starch and Cellulose

<!-- image -->

Both starches and cellulose are carbohydrates which are classified as y
c
assified as 
polysaccharides since they are composed of chains of glucose molecules. While

they are similar, starches can be used as energy sources by the human body while cellulose cannot. Enzymes are important in the metabolism of foods, and these enzymes are very specific. They are somewhat like keys which will fit the geometry of the starch bonds, but not those of the cellulose bonds.

Chitin: Serves similar role to cellulose, but in animals (crustaceans and insects), fungi, and some algae. It is homopolymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Like cellulose, it has and is thus resistant to breakdown.

## Chltln

<!-- image -->

Chitin is a heteropolysaccharides, which is made up of glycans such as Hyaluronic acid, an alternating polysaccharide of D-glucuronic acid and Nacetyl-D-glucosamine; MW to 5,000,000 which serves as a lubricant in joints and is a component of the vitreous humor.

Also very important are the glycans conjugated to proteins and pep tides to give proteoglycans.

## Pectins and Hemicelluloses

Plants also contain more exotic polysaccharides in their cell walls, including pectins and hemicelluloses. Animals likewise have hya]uronan, and other glucosaminoglycans (GAG) in their extracellular matrices. GAGs and pectins are sugar / sugar-acid/ sugar-amine polymers, and hemicellulose is a small polymer of glucose with variable amounts of rhamnose, galactose, xylose, mannose, fucose, and others. Their structures are somewhat complex.

## Structural Unit

<!-- image -->

D-galacturonic acid re si dues form most of the molecules, in blocks of 'smooth' and 'hairy' regions. The molecule does not adopt a straight conformation in solution, but is extended and curved (,worm like') with a large amount of flexibility. The 'hairy' regions of pectins are even more flexible and may have pendant arabinogalactans. The carboxylate groups tend to expand the structure of pectins as a result of their charge, unless they interact through divalent cationic bridging (their pKa of about 2.9 ensuring considerable negative charge under most circumstances). Methylation of these carboxylic acid groups forms their methyl esters, which take up a similar space but are much more hydrophobic and consequently have a different effect on the structuring of the surrounding water. The properties of pectins depend on the degree of esterification, which is normally about 70%. Low methoxyl-pectins « 40% esterified) gel by calcium di-cation bridging between adjacent two-fold helical chains forming so-called 'egg-box' junction zone structures so long as a minimum of 14-20 residues can cooperate. It may well be that the two carboxylate groups have to cooperate together in prizing the bound water away from the calcium ions to form the salt links that make up these junction zones. The gelling ability of the di-cations is similar to that found with the alginates (Mg2+ « Ca2+, Sr2+ &lt; Ba2+) with Na+ and K+ not gelling. If the methoxyl esterified content is greater than about 50%, calcium ions show some interaction but do not gel. The similarity to the behaviour of the alginates is that poly-a-(l,4)-D-galacturonic acid is almost the mirror image of poly-a-(1=4)-L-guluronic acid, the only difference being that the 3-hydroxyl group is axial in the latter. The controlled removal of methoxyl groups, converting high methoxyl pectins to low-methoxyl

pectins, is possible using pectin methylesterases but the reverse process is not easily achieved.

High methoxyl-pectins (&gt; 43% esterified) gel by the formation of hydrogenbonding and hydrophobic interactions in the presence of acids and sugars.

## Function of Pectin

Pectins are mainly used as gelling agents, but can also act as thickener, water binder and stabilizer.

Low methoxyl pectins « 50% esterified) form thermoreversible gels in the presence of calcium ions and at low pH (3 - 4.5) whereas high methoxyl pectins rapidly form thermally irreversible gels in the presence of sufficient (e.g., 65% by weight) sugars such as sucrose and at low pH « 3.5); the lower the methoxyl content, the slower the set.

The degree of esterification can be (incompletely) reduced using commercial pectin methylesterase, leading to a higher viscosity and firmer gelling in the presence of Ca2+ ions. Highly acetylated pectin from sugar beet is reported to have considerable emulsification ability due to its more hydrophobic nature, but this may be due to protein impurities.

As with other viscous polyanions such as carrageenan, pectin may be protective towards milk casein colloids, enhancing the properties (foam stability, solubility, gelation and emulsification) of whey proteins whilst utilizing them as a source of calcium.

## Pectin Substances

Pectin substances are natural components of plants and their fruits. They occur in plants in connection with cellulose and such substances are called protopectin. Protopectin is the binder of cell walls. Especially large amounts of pectin substances are present in fruit such as: currant, gooseberry, citrus fruits and apples. Pectin is a preparation obtained in industrial conditions, containing pectin substances isolated from plant material and soluble in water. Those preparations are used as food and medicine additives and they have the ability to make gels in proper conditions. Raw material for our pectin is dried apple pomace, containing 8-12 % pectin substances, and dried lemon peel, containing 18-25 % pectin substances, from where they are extracted by diluted acid solution and subsequently precipitated by alcohol, purified, dried and crumbled. Being the substance of plant origin, it is the best gelling agent for jams and fruit jellies production. Being the naturally compound of fruit, it makes products manufactured with its addition retain fully organoleptic characteristics.

## Gums

- Gums are hydrocolloids High affinity for H20.
- More complex in structure than starch or pectin.
- Primary building block is galactose (1000 unit).
- They are plant extractives, not digested but are soluble fibres -Low calorie foods.

## Carbohydrates

## Typical Comparison of Storage and Structural Polysachharides

## Storage polysaccharides

- Occurs in the storage organs such as seeds and tubers.
- Include both homo and heteropolysaccharides
- Starch and inulin are homopolysaccharides made from glucose and fructose, respectively.
- Arabinogalactan is an example for storage heteropolysaccharide.
- The configuration of major linkages are a-type.

## Chemical Properties of Carbohydrates

- Reactions of monosaccharides are due to the presence of hydroxyl (-OH) and the potentially free aldehyde (-CHO) or keto ( &gt;C=O) groups.
- Sugars in weak alkaline solutions undergo isomerization to form 1,2enediol followed by the formation of a mixture of sugars.
- Under strong alkaline conditions sugar undergo caramelization reactions.
- Sugars are classified as either reducing or non-reducing depending upon the presence of potentially free aldehyde or keto groups. The reducing property is mainly due to the ability of these sugars to reduce metal ions such as copper or silver to form insoluble cuprous oxide, under alkaline condition. The aldehyde group of aldoses is oxidized to carboxylic acid. This reducing property is the basis for qualitative (Fehling's, Benedict's, Barfoed's and Nylander's tests) and quantitative reactions. All monosaccharides are reducing. In the case of oligosaccharides, if the molecule possesses a free aldehyde or ketone group it belongs to reducing sugar (maltose and lactose). If the reducing groups are involved in the formation of glycosodic linkage, the sugar belongs to the non- reducing group (trehalose, sucrose, raffinose and stachyose).
- When reducing sugars are heated with phenylhydrazine at pH 4.7 a yellow precipitate is obtained. The precipitated compound is called as osazone. One molecule of reducing sugar reacts with three molecules of phenylhydrazine.
- D-mannose and D-fructose form same type of osazone as that of Dglucose since the configuration of C-3, C-4, C-5 and C-6 is same for all the

## Structural polysaccharides

- Important constituents of plant cell wall.
- Include both homo and heteropolysaccharides.
- Cellulose is a homopolysaccharide made up of glucose.
- Hemicelluloses are
- heterpolysaccharides containing pentoses, hexoses and monosaccharide derivatives.
- The configuration of major linkages are

three sugars. The osazone of D-galactose is different. Different sugars form osazone at different rates. For example, D-fructose forms osazone more readily than D-glucose. The osazones are crystalline solids with characteristic shapes, decomposition points and specific optical rotations. The time of formation and crystalline shape of osazone is utilized for identification of sugars. If methyl phenylhydrazine is used instead of phenylhydrazine in the preparation of osazone, only ketoses react. This reaction serves to distinguish between aldose and ketose sugars.

- The hydroxyl group formed as a result of hemiacetal formation in monosaccharides react with methanol and HCl to form methyl a- and glycosides. The derivaties of each sugar are named according to the name of the sugar, that is, the derivaties of glucose as glucosides, of galactose as galactosides and of arabinose as arabinosides etc. Glycosides are acidlabile but are relatively stable at alkaline pH. Since the formation of glycosides convert the aldehydic group to- an acetal group, the glucosides are not a reducing sugars.
- Glycosides are also formed with a non-sugar component, the aglycone. The sugars which are connected to the non-sugar moiety, are pentoses, hexoses, branched sugars or deoxy or dideoxy sugars. The chain length varies from one to five monosaccharide sugar re si dues per glycosides. Apart from O-glycosides, three other classes of glycosides are found in higher plants namely S-glycosides, N-glycosides and C-glycosides.
- Monosaccharides are generally stable to hot dilute mineral acids though ketoses are appreciably decomposed by prolonged action.
- Heating a solution of hexoses in a strong non-oxidising acidic conditions, hydroxy methyl furfural is formed. The hydroxymethyl furfural from hexose is usually oxidized further to other products When phenolic compounds such as resorcinol, a-naphthol or anthrone are added, mixture of coloured compounds are formed.
- The molisch test used for detecting carbohydrate in solution is based on following principle. When conc. H2S04 is added slowly to a carbohydrate solution containing a-naphthol, a pink colour is produced at the juncture. The heat generated during the reaction hydrolyse and dehydrate it to produce furfural or hydroxymethyl furfural which then react with anaphthol to produce the pink colour.
- When sugars are treated with appropriate acid anhydride or acid chloride under proper conditions, the hydroxyl groups get esterified and form sugar esters.

## Lipids and Membranes

The word lipids is derived from the Greek word 'lipoS' meaning fat. Lipids are chemically heterogenous group of compounds that are insoluble in water but soluble in non-polar solvents such as hexane, chloroform. Lipids occur in plants and animals as storage and structural components. Structurallipids present in animals and plants are in the form of meat and vegetables, respectively. Storage fats occur in milk and adipose tissue of farm animals and in seed oils. Fats supply over twice as much ener'gy per unit weight as proteins or carbohydrates, Lipids are anhydrous due to non-polar nature and represent more energy than carbohydrates which are heavily hydrated due to polar nature. The presence of lipids in diet contributes considerably to palatability. A fat- free diet would be unpleasant to eat. Lipids contribute palatability in two ways. They induce olfactory responses, namely, taste in the mouth and aroma through nose, Secondly, they contribute to the texture of food and is responsible for the mouth-feel. Lipids also supply the essential fatty acids which are not synthesised in human beings but are essential for growth. Lipids are essential for the effective absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K from intestine, Many enzymes require lipid molecules for maximal activity. Examples are microsomal enzyme, glucose 6-phosphatase and mitochondrial enzyme, p -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. Adrenal corticosteroids, sex hormones and vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) are synthesized from lipid derivative (cholesterol). Much of the lipid of mammals is located subcutaneously and acts as insulation against excessive heat loss to the environment.

## Classification of Lipids Simple Lipids

- Esters of fatty acids with glycerol and monohydric alcohols.
- Depending upon the constituent alcohols they are further subdivided into fats or oils and waxes.
- Fats, also termed as triacylglycerols are esters of fatty acids with glycerol e.g., Plants-vegetable oils; Animals-ghee and butter.
- Waxes are esters of fatty acids and alcohols other than glycerol e.g., Plant wax-carnauba wax; Insect wax-beeswax; Animal wax -lanolin.

## Compound Lipids

- Esters containing chemical groups in addition to alcohol and fatty acids.
- Depending upon the chemical groups they are further subdivided into phospholipids, glycolipids, sulpholipids and lipoproteins.
- Phospholipids contain phosphate group. Phopholipids are further grouped as glycerophospholipids, if the constituting alcohol is glycerol (e.g., Lecithin) or as sphingophospholipids, if the alcohol is sphingosine (e.g., Sphingomyelin).
- Glycolipids contain hexose units preferably galactose alongwith fatty acids and alcohol e.g., cerebrosides.
- Plant sulpholipids contain sulfated hexose with fatty acids and alcohol.
- Lipoproteins contain protein subunits along with lipids. Depending upon density and lipid compound they are further classified as VLDL. LDL and HDL.

## Derived Lipids

- Substances derived from simple and compound lipids by hydrolysis of alcohols, fatty acids, aldehydes, ketones, sterols and hydrocarbons.

Lipids are water-insoluble that are either hydrophobic (nonpolar) or amphipathic (polar and nonpolar regions). Lipids are in many ways the most diverse of the biological macromolecules, since they are something of a rag-tag bunch of leftovers. Lipids are pretty much everything in the cell that isn't very water soluble, and chemically they don't have a great deal in common with one another. The best known lipids are probably the fatty acids, so that is where we shall start.

## The Fatty Acids

The fatty acids are long chain carboxylic acids synthesised by the condensation and reduction of acetyl co enzyme-A units by fatty acid synthase. The more important ones have nonsystematic names in wide use. Stearic and palmitic acids are saturated (no double bonds), oleic acid is monounsaturated, and linoleic and linolenic are polyunsaturated (Table 3.1). All these common fatty acids are cis (E) fatty acids. Because of the links in the chain caused by the double bonds, the unsaturated fatty acids tend to be liquids at room temperature (they are less easy to pack together to form a solid). Bacteria and plants (which cannot thermoregulate) will use more unsaturated acids in their cell membranes when they are exposed to cold: this helps to maintain membrane fluidity.

The nomenclature of these acids is rather complicated. There are at least five systems in use. Here are some of the above in the different systems. The delta system numbers the double bonds from the carboxyl group (the L'. carbon), whereas the omega system indicates where the first double bond is counting from the other end of the molecule (the (j) carbon).

Table 3.1 : Details of important Saturated and Unsaturated Fatty Acids.

| Fatty Acid      | Systematic                                   | Colon   | Delta                                | Omega   |

Fundamentals ofBiochemistnj : A Textbook

However, the most important use for lipids in the cell is in the formation of membranes. membranes contain amphipathic molecules, i.e., ones with a hydrophobic end and a hydrophilic end.

Some of these lipids contain two fatty acids bound to a glycerol molecule. These are glycerolipids. The third position is taken up by a polar head group containing phosphate and another compound. This other compound can be choiine (as below) forming phosphatidyl choline, or serine (phosphatidyl serine), glycerol, inositol, ethanolamine, hydrogen (phosphatidic acid) or even an entire other diacylglycerol unit (forming a cardiolipin).

## Essential Fatty Acids

Human body is unable to synthesise all fatty acids found in the body. Those fatty acids that are not synthesized in the body but required for normal body growth and maintenance are called as essential fatty acids. These fatty acids are to be supplied through diet. Linoleic and linolenic acids are essential fatty acids. The longer chain fatty acids can be synthesized by the body from dietary linoleic and ex-linolenic acids. Arachidonic acid is essential but it can be synthesised by the body from linolenic acid. It is also present in the meat. Linoleic acid is grouped under n-6 family because the 6th carbon from methyl end possesses the double bond.

## Simple Lipids

Lipids containing only fatty acids and glycerol or long chain a1cohols (monohydric) are called as simple lipids which include fats, oils and waxes.

## Fats and Oils

Triacylglycerols are the simplest lipids constructed from fatty acids and glycerol. They are also referred as triglycerides, fats or neutral fats. Triacylglycerols are composed of three fatty acids esterified to the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol. Triacylglycerol that are solid at room temperature are called as fats, while the liquid triacylglycerols are called as oils. Fats are usually ricq in saturated fatty acids and the unsaturated fatty acids predominate in oils. Most oil-producing plants store their lipids in the form of triacylglycerols.

## Structural or Hidden Fats in Plants

The leaves of higher plants contain upto 7% of their dry weight as fats; some of which are present as surface lipids, the others as components of leaf cells, especially in the chloroplast membrane. The fatty acid composition of plant membrane lipids is very siinple. Six fatty acids- palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and y-linolenic generally account for over 90% of the total fatty acids.

## Waxes

Waxes are esters of long-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids with long chain alcohol (Table 3.2). The carbon number of fatty acids vary from 14 to 34 and that alcohol from 16 to 30.

<!-- image -->

For example, beeswax is an ester of palmitic acid with a 30 carbon alcohol, triacontanol.

<!-- image -->

More commonly, waxes are esters of an alcohol other than glycerol (long chain alcohol, sterol, hydroxycarotenoids, vitamin A) and a long chain acid (wax esters). Wax esters are saponified by hot alkaline solutions and give a fatty acid and an alcohol. They are soluble in aromatic solvents, chloroform, ethers, esters and ketones.

| m-Hydroxy acids    |                     |

Waxes are the chief storage form of metabolic fuel in marine phytoplanktons. Biological waxes have find a variety of applications in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and other industries. Waxes are not easily hydrolysed like fats or digested by lipases.

## Compound Lipids

Compound lipids contain certain chemical groups in addition to alcohol and fatty acids. These group of lipids include glycerophospholipids, sphingo phospholipids, glycolipids, sulpholipids and lipoproteins.

## Glycerophospholipids

The important structural lipid in biological membrane is glycero phospholipid which contains glycerol, fatty acids, phosphoric acid and a nitrogenous base. Two fatty acids and a phosphate esterified to glycerol

<!-- image -->

Without alcoholic residue (R), it is called as phosphatidic acid. Depending on the alcoholic residue attached to phosphatidic acid, they are named as :-

- Phosphatidyl choline (lecithin)
- Phosphatidyl ethanolamine (cephalin)
- Phosphatidyl serine
- Phosphatidyl inositol
- Phosphatidyl glycerol (which include monophosphatidyl glycerol and diphosphatidyl glycerol or cardiolipin).

## Phosphatidyl choline (lecithin)

<!-- image -->

Lecithins are widely distributed in the membranes of cells having both metabolic and structural functions. Dipalmityllecithin is a very effective surface active agent preventing adherence due to surface tension of the inner surfaces of the lungs. Most phospholipids have a saturated fatty acid in the Cl position but an unsaturated fatty acid in the C2 position.

## Phosphatidyl ethanolamine (cephalin)

<!-- image -->

The cephalin differs from lecithin only in the nitrogenous group where ethanolamine is present instead of choline.

## Phosphatidyl serine

<!-- image -->

The hydroxyl group of the amino acid L-serine is esterified to the phosphatidic acid.

## Phosphatidyl inositol

Phosphatidyl inositol is an important constituent of cell membrane phospholipids; upon stimulation by a suitable animal hormone it is cleaved into diacylglycerol and inositol phosphate, both of which act as internal signals or second messengers.

## Phosphatidyl glycerol

<!-- image -->

Cardiolipin is a phospholipid that is found in membranes of mitochondria. It is formed from phosphatidylglycerol.

<!-- image -->

## SphingophosphoIipids

The phosphate and fatty acids are attached to the alcohol sphingosine instead of glycerol in sphingophospholipids. The fatty acids are attached through an amide linkage rather than the ester linkage. The base present is normally choline. C-1, C-2 and C-3 of the sphingosine or phytosphingosine bear functional groups, -OH, -NH2 and -OH respectively, which are structurally homologous with the three hydroxyl groups of glycerol.

All sphingolipids contain a sphingoid long-chain base (e.g., sphingosine) that is linked to a fatty acid molecule through an amide bond, thereby forming the ceramide unit. Addition of phosphocholine or carbohydrates to ceramide leads to sphingomyelin or glycosphingolipids, respectively." (Fig. 3.1)

## Glycolipids and Sulpholipids

Fig. 3.2 : General Structure of Glycolipids

<!-- image -->

Glycolipids are structurally characterised by the presence of one or more monosaccharide residues and the absence of a phosphate (Table 3.2). They are O-glycoside of either sphingosine or glycerol derivative. The monosaccharides commonly attached are D-glucose, D-galactose or N-acetyl D-galactosamine. Monogalactosyl diglycerides and digalactosyl diglycerides have been shown to be present in a wide variety of higher plant tissues.

## Lipoprotein

<!-- image -->

Protein molecules associated with triacylglycerol, cholesterol or phospholipids are called lipoproteins. Triacylglycerols derived from intestinal absorption or from the liver are not transported in the free form in circulating blood plasma, but move as chylomicrons, as very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) or as free fatty acids (FF A) albumin complexes. Besides, two more physiologically important groups of lipoproteins are low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL).

The major lipid components of chylomicrons and VLDL are triacylglycerol, whereas the predominant lipids in LDL and HDL are cholesterol and phospholipids respectively. The protein part of lipoprotein is known as apoprotein. Lipoproteins occur in milk, egg-yolk and also as components of cell membranes.

## Sterols

The characteristic structure of sterol is their steroid nucleus consisting of four fused rings, three with six carbons (Phenanthrene) and one with five carbons (cyclopentane). This parent structure is known as perhydro cyclopentano phenanthrene. Cholesterol is the most abundant sterol in animals. Cholesterol

is a major component of animal plasma membranes and occurs in lesser amounts in the membranes of their subcellular organelles.

In 1979, a novel plant growth regulating steroidal substance called brassinolide was isolated from rape (Brassica napus) pollen. Brassinosteroids are thought by some to be a new class of plant hormones. The evidences are:

- They are widely distributed in the plant kingdom.
- They have an effect at extremely low concentration.
- They have a range of effects which are different from the other classes of plant hormones.
- They can be applied to one part of the plant and transported to another where in very low amounts elicit a biological response.

## Properties of Fat

## Physical

- They are insoluble in water and soluble in organic solvents.
- Pure triacylglycerols are tasteless, odourless, colourless and neutral in reaction.
- They have lesser specific gravity (density) than water and therefore float in water.
- Though fats are insolu1;&gt;le in water, they can be broken down into minute droplets and dispersed in water. This is called emulsification.
- They contain hydrophilic colloidal particles such as proteins, carbohydrates and phospholipids which act as stabilizing agents.
- Emulsification greatly increases the surface area of the fat and this is an essential requisite for digestion of fat in the intestine.

## Chemical

- Fat is hydrolysed to yield three molecules of fatty acid and one molecule of glycerol. The hydrolysis of fat is effected by alkali and enzyme.
- The process of alkali hydrolysis is called 'saponification'.
- The alkali salt of fatty acid resulting from saponification is soap
- Hydrolysis of triacylglycerol may be accomplished enzymatically through the action of lipases.
- Development of disagreeable odour and taste in fat or oil upon storage is called rancidity. Rancidity reactions may be due to hydrolysis of ester bonds (hydrolytic rancidity) or due to oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids (oxidative rancidity).
- The partial hydrolysis of the triacylglycerol to mono and diacylglycerol is called Hydrolytic rancidity. The hydrolysis is hastened by the presence of moisture, warmth and lipases present in fats or air. In fats like butter which contains a high percentage of volatile fatty acids, hydrolytic rancidity produces disagreeable odour and taste due to the liberation of the volatile butyric acid. Butter becomes rancid more easily in summer.
- The unsaturated fatty acids are oxidised at the double bonds to form peroxides, which then decompose to form aldehydes and acids of objectionable odour and taste (Oxidative rancidity).

## Constants of Fats and Oils

Since fats and oils form essential nutrient of human diet, it is necessary to identify a pure fat or to determine the proportion of different types of fat or oil mixed as adulterant in edible oils and fats like butter and ghee. With an adequate knowledge of the characteristic composition of fats or oils, it is possible to identify the fat or oil under investigation. The chemical constants also give an idea about the nature of fatty acids present in fats or oils. Eventhough gas chromatographic method is available to identify and quantify the fatty acids present in fat or oil, the physical and chemical constants are still used in routine public health laboratories where such sophisticated facilities are lacking.

## Physical constants

- Specific Gravity: Since different oils have different specific gravity, any variation from normal value shows mixture of oils.
- Refractive Index: Fats have definite angles of refraction. Variation from the normal value indicates adulteration of fats or oils.

- Solidification Point or Setting Point: Solidification point is the temperature at which the fat after being melted, sets back to solid or just solidifies. Each fat has a specific solidification point.

## Chemical constants

- Saponification number : It is defined as milligrams of KOH required to saponify 1 gm of fat or oil. Saponification number is high for fat or oil containing low molecular weight or short chain fatty acids and vice versa. It gives a clue about the molecular weight and size of the fatty acid in the fat or oil.
- Iodine Number: It is defined as the number of grams of iodine taken up by 100 grams of fat or oil. Iodine number is a measure of the degree of unsaturation of the fatty acid. Since the quantity of the iodine absorbed by the fat or oil can be measured accurately, it is possible to calculate the relative unsaturation of fats or oil.
- Reichert-Meisel Number (RM.number) : It is defined as the number of millilitres of 0.1 N alkali required to neutralise the soluble volatile fatty aicds contained in 5 gm of fat. It measures the volatile soluble fatty acids. It is confined to butter and coconut oil. The determination of Reichert-Meisel number is important to the food chemist because it helps to detect the adulteration in butter and ghee. Reichert-Meisel value is reduced when animal fat is used as adulterant in butter or ghee.
- Polanski Number : It is defined as the number of millilitres of 0.1 N potassium hydroxide solution required to neutralise the insoluble fatty acids (not volatile with steam distillation) obtained from 5 gm of fat.Ghee may be adulterated by the addition of insoluble, non-volatile fatty acids (by addition of animal fat). This can be tested by finding out the Polanski number
- Acetyl Number: It is defined as the amount in millilitres of potassium hydroxide solution required to neutralise the acetic acid obtained by saponification of 1 gm of fat or oil after acetylation. Some fatty acids contain hydroxyl groups. In order to determine the proportion of these, they are acetylated by means of acetic anhydride. This results in the introduction of acetyl groups in the place of free hydroxyl groups. The acetic acid in combination with fat can be determined by titration of the liberated acetic acid from acetylated fat or oil with standard alkali. Acetyl number is thus a measure of the number of hydroxyl groups present in fat or oil.

- Acid Number: It is defined as the milligram of potassium hydroxide required to neutralise the free fatty acids present in one gram of fat or oil. Acid number indicates the amount of free fatty acids present in fat or oil. The free fatty acid content increases with age of the fat or oil.

## Biological Membranes

Proteins and polar lipids account for mass of biological membranes. The relative proportions of protein and lipid differ in different membranes, reflecting the diversity of biological roles. Amphipathic form a lipid bilayer with the non polar region of lipids facing outward. In this lipid bilayer, globular proteins are embedded at regular intervals held by hydrophobic interactions. Some proteins protrude from one or other face of the membrane (peripheral proteins); some span its entire width (integral proteins). The individual lipid and protein subunits in a membrane form a fluid mosaic. The membrane is fluid because the interactions among lipids, between lipids and proteins are non covalent, leaving individual lipid and protein molecules free to move laterally.

One of the key functions of a membrane is to control the passage of substances across it. They are said to be selectively permeable. The different membranes of the cell have different selective permeabilities.

## Common Features

- Membranes are sheetlike, just a few molecules thick and form closed boundaries between cell compartments.
- Membranes contain lipids and proteins, with small amounts of carbohydrayes linked to the lipids and proteins.
- Lipids in membranes are small with hydrophObic and hydrophilic portions. Lipid bilayers provide a barrier to the diffusion of polar molecules.
- Characteristic functions of membranes are mediated by specific proteins, serving as pumps, channels, receptors, energy transducers and enzymes.
- Membrane components associate through noncovalent interactions.
- Membranes are asymmetrical, with two sides of the membrane differing from each other.
- Lipid and protein molecules often diffuse rapidly in the plane of the membrane.

## Bilayer Formation

Hydrophobic interactions provide the primary driving force for the formation of bilayers (Fig. 3.3).

Fig 3.3 : Arrangement of Lipid Bilayer in Cell Membrane

<!-- image -->

Saturated fatty acid chains pack easily and have a higher melting temperature (Tm). Butter is a solid at room temperature so has a high Tm.

Unsaturated fatty acids have a lower Tm. Canola oil is a liquid at room temperature so has a low Tm.

Cholesterol impedes motion of the hydrocarbon tails making membranes less fluid (3.4).

Fig. 3.4 : Typical Structure of Head and Tail of Lipid Bilayer

The degree of saturation of the "tails" affects the stability of the membrane. Saturated fats pack more easily than unsaturated fats. A high percentage of unsaturated fats lowers the temperature at which a membrane will become rigid.

## Fluid Mosaic Model

- The Iipids are arranged in a bilayer, which is both a permeability barrier and solvent for integral proteins (Fig. 3.5).
- Some lipids interact with specific proteins to produce characteristic functions of the membrane.
- Lipids diffuse laterally (horizontally) rapidly but transversely (vertically) slowly. Proteins diffuse laterally.

## Membrane Carbohydrates:

- Common monosaccharides associated with membranes are: glucose, galactose, fructose and mannose.
- Polysaccharides attached to membranes are built from monosaccharides attached to each other via glycosidic bonds.
- Hexoses can be linked from any of 5 positions on the molecule -----&gt; possibility of numerous different structures, i.e., "high information content".
- Both membrane prbteins and lipids can be glycosylated.
- In glycoproteins, the sugar residues are attached to nitrogen of Asn (Nlinked) or via hydroxyl of a Ser or Thr (O-linked).
- Both glycoproteins and glycolipids are important in cell-cell recognition.

## Membrane Asymmetry:

1. Membrane components are asymmetrically distributed across the bilayer.
2. Membranes are asymmetrically oriented: pumps drive transport in one direction receptors bind molecules on the outside
3. Carbohysrates are asymmetric because they are found on the outside of the surface of the cell.

## Glycolipids -

- have an identical structure, except the phosphoryl choline headgroup is replaced with a monosachharide (sugar).

## Peripheral Membrane Proteins:

- Are either extracellular or intracellular.
- Though· associated with membranes they can be easily removed.

## Extracellular Proteins:

- Protein ligands specific for cell surface receptors.
- Proteins of the extracellular matrix.

## Intracellular Proteins:

- Attach to lipid anchors or to integral proteins.
- These proteins can be modified covalently by lipids ----&gt; localizes them to specific membranes.
- Many of these modified proteins are oncoproteins --&gt; cause cancer if they become malfunctional.

## Integral Membrane Proteins:

- Span the bilayer and thus have both intraand extracellular domains.
- The transmembrane domain is always -helical.
- They cannot be removed from the membrane without very harsh treatments.

## They fall into three classes: antigens, receptors and translocators.

## 1. Antigens:

- Integral membrane proteins that are recognized by antibodies.

## 2. Receptors:

- Are required for the specific action of hormones, transmitters and growth factors.
- Three general classes of membranes receptors: receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), small transmembrane helix receptors, receptor channels. growth factor molecule 7

## (a) RTKs bind hormones such as insulin

## They contain:

- An extracellular ligand binding domain.
- A single a-helical transmembrane domain.
- An intracellular domain which can phosphorylate tyrosine residues on proteins.
- (b) Small Molecule 7 Transmembrane Helix Receptors (Fig. 3.6).
- Bind hormones such as epinephrine and glucagon.

Most are G-Proteins- activate other membrane proteins which bind GTP (Fig. 3.7).

## 3. Transporters (Translocators):

The major function of membranes is that of a permeability barrier allowing the cell to maintain distinctly different environments between compartments.

So, cells have evolved transport mechanisms to move things across membranes.

Transporters may be active or passive.

## Active Transport: (Fig. 3.8)

- In some cases the cell "pumps" solutes against their concentration (electrochemical) gradient.
- This is active transport because energy must be expended.
- Na+ / K+ ATPase (or Na+ Pump)
- This "pump" is found in the plasma membrane of ALL mammalian cells.

- Its function is to pump three Na+ ions out of the cell and two K+ ions into the cell, at the expense of one ATP molecule.

## Nucleic Acid Building Blocks

Nucleic acids are composed of nucleotide monomers, which themselves are built from a phosphate group, a sugar, and a nitrogenous base. The bases are of two types, pyrimidines (single ringed) and purines (double ringed).

## Formation of Nucleoside and Nucleotides

Nucleosides and nucleotides are combinations of a base with a sugar. A nucleoside is an N-glycoside formed between a base and a sugar (usually ribose or deoxyribose). A nucleotide is a phosphate ester of a nucleoside. DNA nucleotides are more stable to acid hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond, which is one reason that DNA has superceded RNA as the main genetic storage molecule; it is less prone to mutation.

## Types and Functions of Nucleic Acids

There are two types of nucleic acids, deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA, and ribonucleic acid or RNA. DNA stores genetic information used for the synthesis of proteins including enzymes and is found in the nucleus and mitochondria. RNA has several functions and is found in the nucleus, cytosol and mitochondria. Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries genetic information obtained from DNA to sites that translate the information into a protein. Transfer RNA (tRNA) carries activated amino acids to sites where the amino acids are linked together to form polypeptides. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a structural component of ribosomes, which serve as the sites for protein synthesis. Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is a component of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles. These particles process heterogeneous RNA (hnRNA, the immature form of mRNA) into mature mRNA. In some viruses, HIV, influenza, polio, RNA functions as the storage house of genetic information.

## Primary Structure of Nucleic Acids

The sequence or order of the nucleotides defines the primary structure of DNA and RNA. The nucleotides of the polymer are linked by pbosphodiester bonds

connecting through the oxygen on the 5' carbon of one to the oxygen on the 3' carbon of another. The Oxygen and Nitrogen atoms in the backbone give DNA and RNA "polarity" (Fig. 4.1).

Fig. 4.1 : Nucleotides Linked Through Phosphodiester Bond

<!-- image -->

## Secondary Structure of Nucleic Acids

A purine base always pairs with a pyrimidine base or more specifically Guanosine (G) with Cytosine (C) and Adenine (A) with Thymine (T) or Uracil (U) (Fig. 4.2).

Fig. 4.2 : Base pairing, A with T (A = T) and F with C (CG == C)

<!-- image -->

The G-C pair has three hydrogen bonds while the A-T pair has two hydrogen bonds.

DNA: The secondary structure of DNA consists of two polynucleotide chains wrapped around one another to form a double helix. The orientation of the helix is usually right handed with the two chains running antiparallel to one another (Fig. 4.3).

,

Fig. 4.3: Secondary Structure of DNA

<!-- image -->

## Complementarity

The sequence of bases on each strand are arranged so that all of the bases. on one strand pair with all of the bases on another strand, i.e. the number of guanosines always equals the number of cytosines and the number of adenines always equals the number of thymines.

There are two grooves, one major and one minor, on the double helix. Proteins and drugs interact with the functional groups on the bases that are exposed in the grooves (Fig. 4.4).

Fig. 4.4 : Grooves in Double Stranded DNA

<!-- image -->

The structural forms of DNA can differ in four aspects: the "handedness" (right or left), the length of the helix turn, the number of base pairs per turn, and the difference in size between the major and minor grooves. The most common structural form of DNA is the B-form (Fig. 4.5).

Fig. 4.5 : Different Types of Double Stranded DNA

<!-- image -->

RNA: The secondary structure of RNA consists of a single polynucleotide. RNA can fold so that base pairing occurs between complementary regions. RNA molecules often contain both single- and double-stranded regions. The strands are antiparallel and assume a helical shape. The helices are of the A-form (see above).

The structure of t (transfer) and r(ribosomal) RNA consists of multiple, single stranded, stem-loop structures. The stems consist of helices formed by base pairing of complementary regions within the RNA. The secondary structure of tRNA and rRNA are important for their biological functions, mRNA also assumes some degree of secondary structure but not to the same extent as tRNA andrRNA.

<!-- image -->

Some of the bases in DNA and RNA can be chemically modified via methylation. Enzymes, similar to pro teases, called exo- and endo-nucleases can cleave RNA and DNA. Exonucleases cleave nucleic acids from the ends. Endonucleases recognize specific sequences of duplex DNA and cleave at a specific site within

or near the recognized sequence. The sequences that are recognized range from four to eight base pairs in length. The resulting fragments can be joined to other fragments to create new combinations of DNA sequences.

<!-- image -->

DNA can be denatured into single strands and renatured back into a double helix. Reversible denaturation is essential for the biological processes of replication and transcription; and for molecular biological techniques such as Southern blotting and polymerase chain reactions (PCR's). There are three ways to denature DNA: enzymatically, chemically or with heat. The denaturation of DNA via heat can be followed with a spectrophotometer set to a wavelength of 260 nm. Absorption increases with increasing heat breaking the hydrogen bonds that hold the strands together, unstacking and exposing the bases. This effect is called the hyperchromic effect. The temperature at which 50% of the DNA is denatured is called the melting temperature or Tm. Because GC base pairs are held together with three hydrogen bonds (AT have only two) the higher the percentage of GC base pairs the higher the Tm required to melt the DNA.

<!-- image -->

For renaturation to take place the two strands of DNA must contact one another to initiate base pairing. Once this happens the two strands quickly reassociate along their entire length. Several things influence renaturation: complexity, DNA concentration, cation concentration and temperature. Cations such as sodium, potassium and magnesium decrease the intermolecular repulsion of the negatively charged phosphate backbones of the two DNA strands. Renaturation will only occur if the temperature is below the Tm, however if the temperature is too low the rate of renaturation will decrease. Studies have shown that most of the mammalian renatures DNA consists of repetitive sequences with only about 5 % being unique sequences encoding proteins and enzymes.

Hybridization can occur between complementary strands of nucleic acids derived from different sources. The double stranded nucleic acid that forms is a heteroduplex and the extent of heteroduplexes indicates homology between the two nucleic acid sources. For example, humans and mice mix with ,a very small fraction of the DNA renaturing but humans and chimpanzees give greater than 98% homology. DNA and RNA can also hybridize with one another to form heteroduplexes.

The study of the replication and expression of genetic information involves a unidirectional flow from DNA to RNA to Protein:

## DNA and Inheritance

## Until the 1940s biologists argued about whether DNA or protein was the molecule of heredity.

- Nuclei observed to divide when cells reproduced themselves.
- Large amounts of both DNA &amp; protein in the nucleus.
- Many though protein was most likely molecule of heredity.
- Proteins made of 20 different amino acids- could have more variety than DNA (made of only 4 different bases).

## Pneumonia bacteria have a transforming factor.

- Pneumonia bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae) exist in 2 forms:
- o R (rough): harmless.
- o S (smooth): "wild type", causes disease.
- The S type is coated with a polysaccharide which makes it infective and gives the colonies a smooth appearance.
- Frederick Griffiths about 1928 studied the R &amp; S strains by injecting them into mice.
- o S injected into mice -&gt; pneumonia -&gt; death.
- o R injected into mice -&gt; harmless.
- o Also, boiled S injected into mice -&gt; harmless (bacteria killed by boiling).
- o The Griffiths did a strange experiment and got a strange result:
- Boiled S + live R injected into mice -&gt; pneumonia -&gt; death.
- This was not expected because boiled S and live R were harmless by themselves.
- Took blood samples and found live S in the dead mice.
- Concluded that some factor, a "transforming principle", from the dead S had converted some R bacteria into S bacteria (a genetic change).

Table 4.1 : Summary of Griffith's Experiments

| Injected          | Result     | Live S in Blood?   |
|-------------------|------------|--------------------|
| LiveR             | No disease | No                 |
| LiveS             | Death      | Yes                |
| Killed S          | No disease | No                 |
| Killed S + Live R | Death      | Yes                |

## The transforming factor was found to be DNA.

- Oswald A very wanted to know the nature of the transforming principle.
- Spent many years purifying transforming principle from killed S bacteria.
- Finally determined it was DNA 1944.
- First clear cut evidence for hereditary role of DNA.

## Bacteriophage DNA changes the hereditary functions of bacteria.

- Bacteriophage are a type of virus that attacks bacteria.
- Consist of DNA with a protein coat.
- When virus attacks bacterium its DNA is inserted, but not its protein.
- Viruses alter genetic function of bacteria so that they make virus proteins and DNA.
- Again DNA shown to have a genetic function.

## By the early 1950s, it was believed that the secret of heredity was in the structure of DNA.

- Many laboratories began studying the structure of DNA, hoping to find the secret of heredity.
- The basic composition of DNA was known.
- o A sugar-phosphate backbone, with 4 nucleotide bases (A, C, G &amp; T)

<!-- image -->

(In the diagram S = sugar; P = phosphate; B = base)

- Chargaff had measured t base composition in DNA from many species and found that always A = T and C .::. G.
- X-ray diffraction pictures made by Rosalind Franklin showed that the DNA structure was a helix (2 or more molecules spiraling around each other); the structure appeared to have a uniform thickness.

## Amino Acids and Proteins

The amino acids are the building blocks for proteins - nearly all proteins studied are made from the twenty 11 standard 11 amino acids. Other amino acids are also found in proteins, but most arise by modification from the twenty after they have been incorporated in the protein. All of the standard amino acids are amino acids (except for proline, an imino acid). That is they have an amino group to the carboxyl group (they are 2-amino acids). Thus a1120 of these amino acids share the basic structure below:

<!-- image -->

At neutral pH (pH =7) both the acid and amine groups will be ionized to give the so-called zwitterion form. There is no pH at which the amino acid structure will have no ionized groups.

## Chemistry of Amino Acids

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. They all have the basic structure shown below:

CO-R-N goes anticlockwise

D-amino acid

CO-R-N goes clockwise

Amino acids (in general) are chiral:only the L form is found in proteins, although the D form of alanine is an important component of bacterial cell walls. All amino acids are chiral except glycine. The LID descriptor is an old fashioned version of the SIR descriptor, and almost all amino acids are the (S)-isomer because the R group (not to be confused with an (R) descriptor!) is priority three. Only cysteine is an exception to this rule, because its R side group is -CH2SH, which has higher priority than COOH. The LID descriptors come from the 'CO-

R-N' law: if you place the hydrogen behind the chiral centre, and count round from the COOH group, to the R group, to the NH2 group, this goes anticlockwise, and for similar reason to the RjS descriptor, this means it's the L isomer. The D-isomer goes clockwise.

There are twenty (or so) amino acids, which we will discuss in groups based on their chemical properties.

## The hydrophobic amino acids are-

- Aliphatic: glycine (Gly, G), alanine (Ala, A), leucine (Leu, L), isoleucine (lIe, I), valine (Val, V).
- Sulphur containing: methionine (Met, M).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Methionine

- Aromatic: phenylalanine (Phe, F), tryptophan (Trp, W).

<!-- image -->

Phenylalanine

Tryptophan

<!-- image -->

•

- Cyclic imine: proline (Pro, P).

<!-- image -->

Proline has an unusual imine ring structure (a secondary amine), where the terminal amine group is actually incorporated into the side chain. This causes changes to the secondary structure of a protein. Hydrophobic residues are often found in membrane bound proteins, and the aromatic ones contribute to protein absorbance at 280 nID, which is an important method of protein quantification. Alanine is the 'don't care' amino acid, often appearing where nothing interesting is happening!

The polar amino acids are those that are not charged at physiological pH, but which are nevertheless quite polar due to their alcohol or amide groups.

- Alcohols : threonine (Thr, T), serine (Ser, S).
- Amides : asparagine (Asn, N), glutamine (GIn, Q).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The basic amino acids are those that can accept protons. The pKa refers to the dissociation of the proton from a positively charged (protonated) amine group.

- Imidazole: histidine (His, H, pKa of protonated form of the group C=NH+- = 6.04).

<!-- image -->

Histidine

- Amine: lysine (Lys, K, pKa of protonated form of terminal amine group NH3+ = 10.54).
- Guanidinium: arginine (Arg, R, pKa of protonated form of terminal group -C=NH2+ = 12.48).

<!-- image -->

The acidic amino acids are carboxylic acids, plus an thiol (cysteine) and a phenol (tyrosine) with dissociable S-H or O-H groups:

- Aspartic acid (Asp, D, pKa of COOH group = 3.90).

OH

Aspartic acid

<!-- image -->

- Glutamic acid (Glu, E, pKa of COOH group = 4.07).

<!-- image -->

## Glutamic acid

- Cysteine (Cys, C, pKa of SH group = 8.37).
- Phenol: tyrosine (Tyr, Y, pKa of OH group = 10.46).

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The sodium salt of glutamic acid is the flavour enhancer MSG.

Cysteine is capable of forming a dimer: Cys-SH + Cys-SH = Cys-S-S-Cys. These disulphide bridges (confusingly known as cystine), are responsible for a lot of protein tertiary structures.

The charged (acidic/basic) and polar amino acids are often involved in catalysis, forming covalent products with substrates. The terminal COOH and NH2 groups on an amino acid (and on larger peptides and proteins) may also be charged, as have their own pKa's.

- NH3+ has pKa of c. 9.5
- caOH has pKa of c. 2.5

At physiological pH, amino acids and proteins are usually charged at both ends, a zwitterion.

## Alanine zwitterion.

In addition to the amino acids found in proteins, the cell also contains a number of other aminp acids that are not normally found in peptides. This includes ornithine, an1'mportant intermediate in the urea cycle, selenocysteine, a very rare component of some proteins and homocysteine, an important intermediate in sulphur metabolism.

<!-- image -->

In addition to this, many amino acids in proteins are .modified after translation to incorporate phosphate groups, extra hydrogen, etc. These modified amino acid residues include the phosphorylated alcohol amino acids (Ser, Thr, Tyr), which are phosphorylated by kinase enzymes. This is a common strategy for protein regulation. The histone proteins, which regulate DNA packaging in the nucleus are themselves regulated by methylation of their arginine and lysine residues, and the characteristic triple helical structure of collagen is caused by its possession of many glycine and hydroxyproline (a post-translational modification of proline) residues.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

One final interesting amino acid modification is that found in the methanogenic Archaea. These 'bacteria' interpret the amber stop codon as the amino acid methylpyrrolysine, making this the 22 nd genetically encoded amino acid (the 21 st being the N-formyl methionine that eukaryotes use to start translating all their proteins).

<!-- image -->

N-formyl methionine

## Methylpyrrolysine

All amino acids share two chemically functional groups, the carboxyl group and the amino group. Thus, they will share the chemical reactions of these groups familiar from organic chemistry. Many of these reactions are exploited in the laboratory manipulation of amino acids, peptides, and proteins. Note that these reactions are also common to the side chains of asp, glu (-COOH), and lys (NH2). Another side-chain with important chemistry is cys (-SH). Biologically the most important reactions are those required for protein formation, particularly the peptide bond.

## Classification of Amino Acids

The protein amino acids are classified according to the chemical nature of their R groups as aliphatic, aromatic, heterocyclic and sulphur containing amino acids. More meaningful classification of amino acids is based on the polarity of the R groups. The polarity of the R groups varies widely from totally non-polar to highly polar. The 20 amino acids are classified into four main classes.

## · Amino acids with non-polar or hydrophobic, aliphatic R groups

This group of amino acids includes glycine, alanine, valine, leucine. Isoleucine and proline. The hydrocarbon R groups are non-polar and hydrophobic. The side chains of alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine are important in promoting hydrophobic interactions within protein structures. On the other hand, the imino group of proline is held in a rigid conformation and reduces the structural flexibility of the protein.

## · Amino acids with non-polar aromatic R groups.

This group includes phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. All these amino acids participate in hydrophobic interactions, which is stronger than aliphatic R groups because of stacking one another. Tyrosine and tryptophan are more

## Fundamentals ofBiochemistnj : A Textbook

polar than phenylalanine due to the presence of hydroxyl group in tyrosine and nitrogen in the indole ring of tryptophan. The absorption of ultraviolet (UV) light at 280 nm by tyrosine, tryptophan and to a lesser extent by phenylalanine is responsible for the characteristic strong absorbance of light by proteins. This property is exploited in the characterization and quantification of proteins.

## · Amino acids with polar, uncharged R groups.

This group of amino acids includes serine, threonine, cysteine, methionine, asparagine and glutamine. The hydroxyl group of serine and threonine, the sulphur atom of cysteine and methionine and the amide group of asparagine and glutamine, contribute to the polarity. The R groups of these amino acids are more hydrophilic than the non-polar amino acids.

## · Amino acids with charged R groups.

Acidic: The two amino acids with acidic R groups are aspartic and glutamic acids. These amino acids have a net negative charge at pH 70.

Basic: This group includes lysine, arginine and histidine. The R groups have a net positive charge at pH 7.0. The lysine has a second E-amino group; arginine has a positively charged guanidino group; and histidine has an imidazole group.

## Essential Amino Acids

Most of the prokaryotic and many eukaryotic organisms (plants) are capable of synthesizing all the amino acids present in the protein. But higher animals including man possess this ability only for certain amino acids. The other amino acids, which are needed for normal functioning of the body but cannot be synthesized from metabolic intermediates, are called essential amino acids. These must be obtained from the diet and a deficiency in anyone of the amino acids prevents growth and may even cause death. Methionine, Threonine, Tryptophan, Valine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Phenylalanine and Lysine are the essential amino acids, however, Histidine and Arginine .are considered semi essential amino acids as it can be partly synthesized by the body.

## Properties of Amino Acids

## Physical

- Amino acids are white crystalline substances. Most of them are soluble in water and insoluble in non-polar organic solvents (e.g., chloroform and ether).

## Amino Acids and Proteins

- Aliphatic and aromatic amino acids particularly those having several carbon atoms have limited solubility in water but readily soluble in polar organic solvents.
- They have high melting points varying from 200-300 o C or even more.
- They are tasteless, sweet or bitter. Some are having good flavour.
- Amphoteric nature of amino acids as they contain both acidic (COOH) and basic (NH2) groups. The amino acids possessing both positive and negative charges are called zwitterions.
- Isomerism -All amino acids except proline, found in protein are a-amino acids because NH2 group is attached to the a-carbon atom, which is next to the COOH group. Examination of the structure of amino acids reveals that except glycine, all other amino acids possess asymmetric carbon atom at the position.

## Chemical Properties

- Reaction with formaldehyde (Formal titration): An amino acid solution is treated with excess of neutralized formaldehyde solution, the amino group combines with formaldehyde forming dimethylol amino acid which is an amino acid formaldehyde complex Hence the amino group is protected and the proton released is titrated aga1nst alkali. This method is used to find out the amount of total free amino acids in plant samples.
- Reaction with nitrous acid: Nitrous acid reacts with the amino group of amino acids to form the corresponding hydroxyacids and liberate nitrogen gas.
- Reaction with ninhydrin: Ninhydrin is a strong oxidizing agent. When a solution of amino acid is boiled with ninhydrin, the amino acid is oxidatively deaminated to produce ammonia and a ketoacid. The keto acid is decarboxylated to produce an aldehyde with one carbon atom less than the parent amino acid. The net reaction is that ninhydrin oxidatively deaminates and decarboxylates a-amino acids to C02, NH3 and an aldehyde. The reduced ninhydrin then reacts with the liberated ammonia and another molecule of intact ninhydrin to produce a purple coloured compound known as Ruhemann's purple.
- This ninhydrin reaction is employed in the quantitative determination of amino acids. Proteins and peptides that have free amino group(s) (in the side chain) will also react and give colour with ninhydrin.
- Decarboxylation: The carboxyl group of amino acids is decarboxylated to yield the corresponding amines. Thus, the vasoconstrictor agent, histamine

Fundamentals of Biochemistry : A Textbook

is produced from histidine. Histamine stimulates the flow of gastric juice into the stomach and the dilation and constriction of specific blood vessels. Excess reaction to histamine causes the symptoms of asthma and various allergic reactions.

## Peptides

Amino acids are linked together by formation of covalent bonds. The covalent bond is formed between the a-carboxyl group of one amino acid and the aamino group of the next amino acid. The bond so formed between the carboxyl and the amino groups, after elimination of a water molecule is called as a peptide bond and the compound formed is a peptide.

<!-- image -->

- The peptide bond is formed with the elimination of water, glvmg a planar bond between the carboxyl carbon and the amino nitrogen.
- Linear peptides will have free amino- and carboxy- terminal groups. Thus they will exhibit titration curves similar to a free amino acid, but with the pKa values shifted closer to simple acid and amine values (there will be no charge stabilization).
- By convention the amino terminal residue is written on the left progressing to the carboxyl terminal residue on the right: +H3N-aa-aa-aaaa-C02-.
- Can determine the composition of a peptide by acid hydrolysis and amino acid analysis.
- Can sequence proteins by specific enzyme and chemical hydrolysis to give pep tides which can then be run through sequenators (up to about 100 aa's).
- Amino acid sequences have been used to help determine relatedness of organisms.

## Classification of Protein: Proteins are classified based on their

- (A) Solubility and composition.
- (B) Function.
- (C) Size &amp; Shape.

## (A) Classification of Proteins Based on Solubility and Composition

Proteins are again divided into three main groups as simple, conjugated and derived proteins.

## (I) Simple Proteins

Simple proteins yield on hydrolysis, only amino acids. These proteins are further classified based on their solubility in different solvents as well as their heat coagulability.

## Albumins

Albumins are readily soluble in water, dilute acids and alkalies and coagulated by heat. Seed proteins contain albumin in lesser quantities. Albumins may be precipitated out from solution using high salt concentration, a process called 'salting out'. They are deficient in glycine. Example Serum albumin and Ovalbumin (egg white).

## Globulins

Globulins are insoluble or sparingly soluble in water, but their solubility is greatly increased by the addition of neutral salts such as sodium chloride. These proteins are coagulated by heat. They are deficient in methionine. Example Serum globulin, Fibrinogen, Myosin of muscle and Globulins of pulses.

## Prolamins

Prolamins are insoluble in water but soluble in 70-80% aqueous alcohol. Upon hydrolysis they yield much proline and amide nitrogen. They are deficient in lysine. Example - Gliadin of wheat and Zein of corn.

## Glutelins

Glutelins are insoluble in water and absolute alcohol but soluble in dilute alkalies and acids. They are plant proteins. Example - Glutenin of wheat.

## Histones

Histones are small and stable basic proteins and contain fairly large amounts of basic amino acid, histidine. They are soluble in water, but insoluble in ammonium hydroxide. They are not readily coagulated by heat. They occur in globin of haemoglobin and nucleoproteins.

## Protamines

Protamines are the simplest of the proteins. They are soluble in water and are not coagulated by heat. They are basic in nature due to the presence of large quantities of arginine. Protamines are found in association with nucleic acid in the sperm cells of certain fish. Tyrosine and tryptophan are usually absent in protamines.

## Albuminoids

These are characterized by great stability and insolubility in water and salt solutions. These are called albuminoids because they are essentially similar to albumin and globulins. They are highly resistant to proteolytic enzymes. They are fibrous in nature and form most of the supporting structures of animals. They occur as chief constituent of exoskeleton structure such as hair, horn and nails.

## (11) Conjugated or Compound Proteins

These are simple proteins combined with some non-protein substances known as prosthetic groups. The nature of the non-protein or prosthetic groups is the basis for the sub classification of conjugated proteins.

## Nucleoproteins

Nucleoproteins are simple basic proteins (protamines or his tones) in salt combination with nucleic acids as the prosthetic group. They are the important constituents of nuclei and chromatin.

## Mucoproteins

These proteins are composed of simple proteins in combination with carbohydrates like mucopolysaccharides, which include hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphates. On hydrolysis, mucopolysaccharides yield more than 4 % of amino-sugars, hexosamine and uronic acid e.g., ovomucoid from egg white. Soluble mucoproteins are neither readily denatured by heat nor easily precipitated by common protein precipitants like trichloroacetic acid or picric acid. The term glycoproteins is restricted to those proteins that contain small amounts of carbohydrate usually less than 4 % hexosamine.

## Chromoproteins

These are proteins containing coloured prosthetic groups e.g., haemoglobin, flavoprotein and cytochrome.

## Lipoproteins

These are proteins conjugated with lipids such as neutral fat, phospholipids and cholesterol.

## MetaIloproteins

These are metal-binding proteins. A f3-globulin, termed transferrin is capable of combining with iron, copper and zinc. This protein constitutes approximately 3 % of the total plasma protein. Another example is ceruloplasmin, which contains copper.

## Phosphoproteins

These are proteins containing phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid is linked to the hydroxyl group of certain amino acids like serine in the protein, Example- casein of milk.

## (Ill) Derived Proteins

These are proteins derived by partial to complete hydrolysis from the simple or conjugated proteins by the action of acids, alkalies or enzymes. They include two types of derivatives, primary-derived proteins and secondary-derived proteins.

## Primary-derived Proteins

These protein derivatives are formed by processes causing only slight changes in the protein molecule and its properties. There is little or no hydrolytic cleavage of peptide bonds.

## Proteans

Proteans are insoluble products formed by the action of water, dilute acids and enzymes. These are particularly formed from globulins but are insoluble in dilute salt solutions. Example myosan from myosin, fibrin from fibrinogen.

## Metaproteins

These are formed by the action of acids and alkalies upon protein. They are insoluble in neutral solvents.

## Coagulated Proteins

Coagulated proteins are insoluble products formed by the action of heat or alcohol on natural proteins. Example - cooked meat and cooked albumin.

## Secondary-derived Proteins

These proteins are formed in the progressive hydrolytic cleavage of the peptide bonds of protein molecule. They are roughly grouped into proteoses, pep tones and peptides according to average molecular weight. Proteoses are hydrolytic products of proteins, which are soluble in water and are not coagulated by heat. Pep tones are hydrolytic products, which have simpler structure than proteoses. They are soluble in water and are not coagulated by heat. Pep tides are composed of relatively few amino acids. They are water-soluble and not coagulated by heat. The complete hydrolytic decomposition of the natural protein molecule into amino acids generally progresses through successive stages as follows:

Protein Protean Metaprotein

Proteoses Peptones Peptides amino acids

## (B) Classification of Proteins Based on Function

Proteins are classified based on their functions as -

## (I) Catalytic Proteins - Enzymes

The most striking characteristic feature of these proteins is their ability to function within the living cells as biocatalysts. These biocatalysts are called as enzymes. Enzymes represent the largest class. Nearly 2000 different kinds of enzymes are known, each catalyzing a different kind of reaction. They enhance the reaction rates a million fold.

## (11) Regulatory Proteins - Hormones

These are polypeptides and small proteins found in relatively lower concentrations in animal kingdom but play highly important regulatory role in maintaining order in complex metabolic reactions. Example- growth hormone, insulin etc.

## (Ill) Protective Proteins - Antibodies

Some proteins have protective defense function. These proteins combine with foreign protein and other substances and fight against certain diseases.Exampleimmunoglobulin. These proteins are produced in the spleen and lymphatic cells in response to foreign substances called antigen. The newly formed protein is called antibody which specifically combines with the antigen which triggered its synthesis thereby prevents the development of diseases. Fibrin present in the blood is also a protective protein.

## (IV) Storage Proteins

A major class of proteins which has the function of storing amino acids as nutrients and as building blocks for the growing tissues. Storage proteins are source of essential amino acids, which cannot be synthesized by human beings. The major storage protein in pulses is globulins and prolamins in cereals. But in rice the major storage protein is glutelins. Albumin of egg and casein of milk are also storage proteins.

## (V) Transport Proteins

Some proteins are capable of binding and transporting specific types of molecules through blood. Haemoglobin is a conjugated protein composed of colourless basic protein, the globin and ferroprotoporphyrin or haem. It has the

## Amino Acids and Proteins'

capacity to bind with oxygen and transport through blood to various tissues. Myoglobin, a related protein, transports oxygen in muscle. Lipids bind to serum proteins, principally, albumin and transported as lipoproteins in the blood.

## (VI) Toxic Proteins

Some of the proteins are toxic in nature. Ricin present in castor bean is extremely toxic to higher animals in very small amounts. Enzyme inhibitors such as trypsin inhibitor bind to digesti\'e enzyme and prevent the availability of the protein. Lectin, a toxic protein present commonly in legumes, agglutinates red blood cells. A bacterial toxin causes cholera, which is a protein. Snake venom is protein in nature.

## (VII) Structural Proteins

Some proteins serve as structural materials or as important components of extra cellular fluid. Examples of structural proteins are myosin of muscles, keratin of skin and hair and collagen of connective tissue. Carbohydrates, fats, minerals and other cellular components are organized around such structural proteins that form the molecular framework of living material.

## (VIII) Contractile Proteins

Proteins like actin and myosin function as essential elements In contractile system of skeletal muscle.

## (IX) Secretary Proteins

Fibroin is a protein secreted by spiders and silkworms to form webs and cocoons.

## (X) Exotic Proteins

Antarctic fishes live in -1.90C waters, well below the temperature at which their blood is expected to freeze. These fishes are prevented from freezing by antifreeze glycoproteins present in their body.

## (C) Classification of Proteins Based on Size and Shape

Based on size and shape, the proteins are also subdivided into globular and fibrous proteins. Globular proteins are mostly water-soluble and fragile in nature. Example- enzymes, hormones and antibodies. Fibrous proteins are tough and water-insoluble. They are used to build a variety of materials that support and protect specific tissues. Example- Skin, Hair, Fingernails and Keratin.

## Conformation of Proteins

Conformation of a protein refers to the three-dimensional structure in its native state. There are many different possible conformations for a molecule as large as a protein. Four types of structural organization can be distinguished in proteins: (Fig. 5.1)

Fig. 5.1 : Structural Organization of Proteins

<!-- image -->

## Primary structure

The linear order or sequence of peptide bonded amino acid re si dues, beginning at the N-terminus. (Characteristic bond type: covalent).

Primary structure of protein refers to the number of amino acids and the order in which they are covalently linked together. It also refers to the location of disulfide bridges, if there are any, in a polypeptide chain (Fig 5.2).

Fig. 5.2 : Primary Structure of Proteins

<!-- image -->

Frederick Sanger in 1953 determined the complete amino acid sequence of insulin for the first time. The important steps involved in determining the primary structure of protein are-

- Determination of number of (chemically different) polypeptide chains or subunits in the protein.
- Separation of polypeptide chains if more than one are present in a protein.
- Determination of the amino acid sequence of the suhunits.
- Elucidation of the position of the disulphide bonds, if any, between and within the subunits.

Edman's reagent is also used to determine the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide chain from the N-terminal by subjecting the polypeptide to repeated cycles of Edman degradation. After every cycle, the newly Hberated phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) amino acid was identified. The sequence of peptides containing 30-40 amino acids can be determined using a sequencer by adopting the Edman's degradation method.

C-terminal identification: C-terminal amino acid can be determined by methods similar to those used for the N-terminal acid. Hydrazine is used to find out the C-terminal amino acid.

## Amino Acid Sequencing of Polypeptides

The amino acid sequence in polypeptides with 30-40 amino acids can be determined by Edman reaction. For polypeptides containing more than 40 amino acids, both enzymatic and chemical methods are employed to break polypeptide chains into smaller peptides. The enzyme, trypsin hydrolyses the peptide bond on the carboxyl side of the basic amino acid residues of lysine or arginine. The chemical reagent, cyanogen bromide cleaves peptide bond on the carboxyl side of methionine residues. The hydrolyzed peptides are separated and the amino acid sequence is determined by Edman reaction. The hydrolysis of the original polypeptide by two different methods separately gives overlapping regions, from which the sequence is derived.

## Secondary Structure

The steric relations of residues nearby in the primary structure which give rise to local regularities of conformation. These structures are maintained by hydrogen bonds between peptide bond carbonyl oxygens and amide hydrogens. The major secondary structural elements are the helix and the beta strand. (Characteristic bond type: hydrogen.)

Secondary structure refers to the steric relationship of amino acids that are close to one another in the linear sequence. The folding of a linear polypeptide chain occurs to form a specific coiled structure. Such coiling or folding is maintained by hydrogen bonds and hydrogen bond is the only bond responsible for secondary structure. X-ray studies of several polypeptides by Linus Pauling and Robert Corey revealed that the peptide group has a rigid, planar structure which is a consequence of resonance interactions that give the peptide bond a 40% double bond character. Peptide groups mostly assume the trans-conformation in which successive C2 atoms are on opposite sides of peptide bond joining them. The cis configuration creates steric interference. If a polypeptide chain is twisted by the same amount each of its C atoms, it assumes a helical conformation (Fig 5.3).

## Helix Structure

The a-helix is the most stable arrangement of polypeptides. The helix structure of proteins is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding.

In this structure, hydrogen bonds are formed between the C=O group of one peptide bond and the N-H group of another after 3 amino acid units. The polypeptide chain constituted by L-amino acids form a right-handed helix, whereas the polypeptide chains made up of D-amino acids form a left-handed helix. In the a-helical conformation, all the side chains lie outside the helix whereas C, N, 0 and H of the peptide bond lie in the same plane.

Certain amino acids tend to disrupt the a-helix. Among these are proline (the Natoms is part of the rigid ring and no rotation of the N-C bond can occur) and amino acid with charged or bulk R groups that either electrostatically or physically interferes with helix formation.

## The fJ-pleated Sheet Structure

Pauling and Corey also proposed a second ordered structure, the p-pleated sheet. for polypeptide. This structure is a result of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the polypeptide chains to form a sheet like arrangement (Fig. 5.3).

There are two ways in which proteins chains can form the pleated sheet structure. One is with the chains running in the same direction i.e. the -COOH or NH2 ends of the polypeptide chains lying all at the top or all at the bottom of the sheet. This is called parallel pleated-sheet structure. In another type, known as antiparallel sheet structure, the polypeptide chains alternate in such a way that the -COOH end of the one polypeptide is next to the -NH2 end of the other i.e., polypeptide chains run in opposite directions.

<!-- image -->

## The Random Coil

Regions of proteins that are not identifiably organized as helices or pleated sheets are said to be present in random coil conformation. Considerable portion of the protein may be present in this conformation. The term 'random' is unfortunate which imply less biological significance than more highly repeating regions. But in terms of biological function, the regions of random coil are of equal importance to those of helix and pleated sheet.

## Tertiary Structure

The steric relations of residues distant in the primary sequence; the overall folding pattern of a single covalently linked molecule. (Characteristic bond type: hydrophobic; others: hydrogen, ion-pair, van der Waals, disulphide.)

## Hydrogen Bonds

Hydrogen bonds are formed between the side chain (R group) of amino acids having a hydrogen donor group and an acceptor group.

## Salt-linkages (electrostatic forces; ionic bonds)

Salt linkages are due to the interaction between amino groups of basic amino acids and the carboxyl group of acidic amino acids present in the R group.

## Disulphide Bonds (S-S linkages)

The S-S linkages are formed by the oxidation of sulfhydryl (-SH) group of two cysteine side chains.

## Hydrophobic Bonds

Hydrophobic bonds are formed as a result of interaction between non-polar side chains.

## Dipole-dipole Interaction

This interaction occurs between polar unionized side chains.

The folding of a polypeptide chain due to different covalent and non-covalent interactions (Fig. 5.4).

Out of the above bonds, the disulphide bond (covalent bond) is the strongest and cannot be affected by solvent, pH, temperature and salts whereas the above conditions. The disulphide bond can be split and reformed by oxidation/reduction respectively. The tertiary structure gains special importance in the case of enzymes.

## Domain

Independent folding regions within a protein. The group/pattern of secondary structures forming a Domain's tertiary structure is called a Fold. (Characteristic bond type: hydrophobic; others: hydrogen, ion-pair, van der Waals.)

A long peptide strand of a protein will often fold into multiple, compact semiindependent folded regions or domains. Each domain having a characteristic spherical geometry with a hydrophobic core and polar surface very much like the tertiary structure of a whole globular protein. The domains of a multidomain protein are often interconnected by a segment of polypeptide chain lacking regular secondary structure. In enzymes with more than one substrate or allosteric effector sites the different binding sites are often located in different domains. In multifunctional proteins, the different domains perform different tasks.

## Quaternary Structure

The association of two or more independent proteins via non-covalent forces to give a multimeric protein. The individual peptide units of this protein are referred to as subunits, and they may be identical or different from one another. (&lt;;:haracteristic bond type: hydrophobic; others: hydrogen, ion-pair, van der Waals.)

Proteins that have more than one subunit or polypeptide chains will exhibit quaternary structure (Fig. 5.5). Quaternary structure refers to a functional protein aggregate (organization) formed by interpolypeptide linkage of subunits or polypeptide chains. These subunits are held together by noncovalent surface

interaction between the polar side chains. Proteins formed like above are termed oligomers and the individual polypeptide chains are variously termed protomers, monomers or subunits. The most common oligomeric proteins contain two or four protomers and are termed dimers or tetramers. respectively.

## Physical and Chemical Properties of Proteins

## Physical Properties

- Pure proteins are generally tasteless, though the predominant taste of protein hydrolysates is bitter.
- Pure proteins are odourless.
- Because of the large size of the molecules, proteins exhibit many properties that are colloidal in nature.
- Proteins, like amino acids, are amphoteric and contain both acidic and basic groups.
- They possess electrically charged groups and hence migrate in an electric field.
- Many proteins are labile and readily modified by alterations in pH, UV radiation, heat and by many organic solvents.
- The absorption spectrum of protein is maximum at 280 nm due to the presence of tyrosine and tryptophan, which are the strongest chromophores in that region. Hence the absorbance of the protein at this wavelength is adapted for its determination.

Denaturation of protein The comparatively weak forces responsible for maintaining secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins are readily disrupted with resulting loss of biological activity. This disruption of native structure is termed denaturation.

Physical and chemical factors are involved in the denaturation of protein:

- Heat and UV radiation supply kinetic energy to protein molecules causing their atoms to vibrate rapidly, thus disrupting the relatively weak hydrogen bonds and salt linkages. This results in denaturation of protein leading to coagulation. Enzymes easily digest denatured or coagulated proteins.
- Organic solvents such as ethyl alcohol and acetone are capable of forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds with protein disrupting the intramolecular hydrogen bonding. This causes precipitation of protein.
- Acidic and basic reagents cause changes in pH, which alter the charges present on the side chain of protein disrupting the salt linkages.
- Salts of heavy metal ions (Hg2+, Pb2+) form very strong bonds with carboxylate anions of aspartate and glutamate thus disturbing the salt linkages. This property makes some of the heavy metal salts suitable for use as antiseptics.

Renaturation -Renaturation refers to the attainment of an original, regular threedimensional functional protein after its denaturation.

When active pancreatic ribonuclease A is treated with 8M urea or pmercaptoethanol, it is converted to an inactive, denatured molecule. When urea or mercaptoethanol is removed, it attains its native (active) conformation.

## Chemical Properties

- Colour Reactions of Proteins -The colour reactions of proteins are of importance in the qualitative detection and quantitative estimation of proteins and their constituent amino acids. Biuret test is extensively used as a test to detect proteins in biological materials.
- Biuret Reaction - A compound, which is having more than one peptide bond when treated with Biuret reagent, produces a violet colour. This is due to the formation of coordination complex between four nitrogen atoms of two polypeptide chains and one copper atom.
- Xanthoproteic Reaction Addition of concentrated nitric acid to protein produces yellow colour on heating, the colour changes to orange when the solution is made alkaline. The yellow stains upon the skin caused by nitric acid are the result of this xanthoproteic reaction. This is due to the nitration of the phenyl rings of aromatic amino acids.
- Hopkins-Cole Reaction Indole ring of tryptophan reacts with glacial acetic acid in the presence of concentrated sulphuric acid and forms a purple coloured product. Glacial acetic acid reacts with concentrated sulphuric acid and forms glyoxalic acid, which in turn reacts with indole ring of tryptophan in the presence of sulphuric acid forming a purple coloured prod uet.

## Myoglobin and Haemoglobin

Myoglobin (Mb) : Myoglobin is a 153 residue globular protein in the globin family. Eight helices form its single domain (myoglobin fold) tertiary structure; about 80% helix (high for globular proteins). Interior almost exclusively hydrophobic residues, with water excluded from interior. Surface has mix of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, with ionizable groups on surface.

## Amino Acids and Proteins

Haemoglobin (Hb): Haemoglobin is an --beta-beta oligomeric protein: its quaternary structure consists of a tetramer of myoglobin like subunits. The two types of chain are slightly shorter than myoglobin chains ( = 141 amino acid residues, beta = 146 amino acid residues). There are extensive contacts between an and a beta subunit to give a dimer. The dimers have additional contacts to give the tetramer. Oxygen binding results in a change of conformation in Hb. The change of conformation affects the binding of oxygen {oxygen binding is reduced in the "blue" form due to steric hindrance between the oxygen and the haeme}.

- Structure very similar to Mb.
- Exception: tetramer, two types of subunits.
- Two ex and two referred to as hba-normal hemoglobin).
- Cooperativity jCooperative Binding.
- When an 02 molecule binds to the first site a conformational change occurs in the tetrameric structure which affects binding to the other subunits.
- Oxygen binding curve is a characteristic sigmoidal ("5") shape.
- Hb takes up 02 in the lungs and releases it to interior tissues.
- At p020f 100 mmHg, Hb is saturated.
- At p02 of 20 mmHg, Hb loses most of its 02.
- Even at 40 mmHg Hb is loosing some of it's 02.

## Note:

- The amount of Hb in the blood is so high that it contributes to the buffering capacity of blood.
- Bicarbonate system is still the major blood buffer, however
- Hb does have the ability to accept or donate protons through its His residues (36 His residues per tetramer, so this cannot be discounted . .... ) ).

## AIJosterism and Regulation

Allosteric ("other site") enzyme or binding proteins are proteins with multiple interacting sites. Allosteric proteins can exhibit one or both of two types of allosterism:

- Homotropic: this is where the sites are identical, and each sites is allosteric to the others. This is like the cooperative interactions seen in oxygen binding by haemoglobin four (essentially) identical oxygen binding sites interacting with each other allosterically.
- Heterotropic: this is where binding at one kind of site affects the binding at a second kind of site. This occurs in the regulation of oxygen binding in haemoglobin by BPG (BisPhosphoGlycerate == DPG in older literature). BPG affects the binding of oxygen by all of the oxygen sites. [Hb overheads].

Look at cooperativity/regulation curves for enzymes/binding proteins. Get two families of regulators:

- Positive (+) effectors or activators. These shift the binding constant so the binding takes place at lower concentrations, or increases the rate of an enzyme at a given concentration. Positive (+) effectors decrease cooperativity.
- Negative (-) effectors : Decrease binding, so concentration must be increased to give the same level of activity. Negative (-) effectors increase cooperativity.

So how to explain the cooperative behaviour of allosteric proteins? Need to explain both kinds of effects.

- Homotropic allosterism as occurs with 02 binding in Hb.
- Heterotropic regulation of O2 binding, as occurs with BPG in Hb.

Two Important Models: Symmetry Model of Allosterism and Sequential Model of Allosterism.

## Fundamentals of Biochemistry : A Textbook

## Symmetry Model of A1losterism

- Allosteric protein have an oligomer of protein subunits that are symmetrically related;
- Protomers can exist in two conformations (designated T[ense): low affinity for substrate, &amp; R[elaxed): high affinity for substrate) that are in equilibrium whether or not ligand is bound;
- Ligand can bind to protomers in either conformation, but conformational change alters affinity for the ligand;
- The molecular symmetry of the protein is conserved during conformational change: the protomers must therefore change in a concerted manner.
- It can also be added binding of effectors to this model: positive effectors bind to R (circles) and shift equilibrium to right, negative effectors bind to T (squares) and shift equilibrium to left.

<!-- image -->

## Sequential Model of A1losterism.

In this model the subunits are each influenced by binding to other subunits, but change is step-wise rather than concerted.

## Enzymes and Kinetics

## Enzymes are the heart of Biochemistry.

- Protein based catalysts.
- Enormously effective catalysts: typically enhance rates by 10 6 to 1012 fold.
- Operate under mild conditions: 0 - 100 QC (or perhaps even 300+ QC for some bacteria in deep ocean), 20 40 QC for most organisms; and low pressures (atmospheric).
- Very Specific: Generally catalyze reaction for a very restricted group of molecules, sometimes for a single naturally occurring molecule of a single chirality.

Enzymes generally have a cleft for active site, generally &lt;5%of surface: look like pac man. Need large structure to maintain shape etc., with many weak bonds.

One of the unique characteristics of a living cell is its ability to permit complex reactions to proceed rapidly at the temperature of the surrounding environment. The principal agents which participate in the remarkable transformations in the cell belong to a group of proteins named enzymes. In the absence of enzymes in the cell, these reactions would proceed too slowly. Enzymes are proteins specialized to catalyse biological reactions with the following characteristics.

## Characteristics of Enzymes

Enzymes being proteins exhibit all properties of proteins. They have their specific isoelectric points at which they are least soluble. Like proteins, they can be denatured by changes in pH and temperature. The enzyme-catalysed reactions occur below 100oC, at atmospheric pressure and nearby neutral pH.

Enzymes undergo physical changes during the reaction but revert to their original form at the end of the reaction. Enzymes exhibit enormous catalytic power. The rates of enzymatically catalysed reactions are 106 -1012 times greater than those of the corresponding uncatalysed reactions and several times greater than those of the corresponding chemically catalysed reactions. For example the carbonic anhydrase enzyme catalyses the conversion of carbondioxide to carbonic acid.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In this reaction, each enzyme molecule can hydrate 105 molecules of carbondioxide per second.

Enzyme activity is regulated in a variety of ways, ranging from controls over the amount of enzyme protein synthesised by the cell or modulation of activity through reversible interaction with metabolic inhibitors and activators or through isoenzymes.

## Specificity of the Enzymes

One of the characteristic feature which distinguishes enzymes from catalysts is their specificity. Enzymes are specific in the reaction catalysed and in their choice of substrates. It usually catalyses a single chemical reaction or a set of closely related reactions. Three kinds of specificities are observed.

## Absolute Specificity

When enzymes catalyse only one particular reaction they are said to exhibit absolute specificity. e.g., Urease acts only on urea.

## Group Specificity

Enzymes acting on a group of substances that possess a particular type of linkage common to that group of substances are said to exhibit group specificity. Amylase hydrolyses the group of substances like starch, dextrin and glycogen, which have the same type of glycosidic linkages (a. 1,4).

## Optical Specificity

Almost all enzymes show a high degree of optical specificity. Thus, there are certain enzymes which catalyse the hydrolysis of same group of substances possessing same optical activity i.e., D-amino acid oxidase acts on D-amino acid and L-amino acid oxidase acts on L-amino acid. Maltase catalyses the hydrolysis of a.-but not 13- glycosides.

## Classification of Enzymes

The International Union of Biochemistry (IUB) established a comrrnSSlOn on enzyme nomenclature to adopt a systematic classification and nomenclature of all the existing and yet to be discovered enzymes. This system is based on the substrate and reaction specificity. Although, this International Union of Biochemistry system is complex, it is precise, descriptive and informative.

IUB system classifies enzymes into six major classes (should be written in specific order only).

## 1. Oxidoreductases

2. T ransferases
3. Hydrolases
4. Lyases
5. Isomerases
6. Ligases

Again each class is divided into subclasses according to the type of reaction catalysed. Each enzyme is assigned a recommended name usually a short one for everyday use, a systematic name which identify the reaction it catalyses and a classification number which is used where accurate and unambiguous identification of an enzyme is required (Table 6.1).

## Comparision of Apoenzymes, Co enzymes and Cofactors

A large number of enzymes require an additional non-protein component to carry out its catalytic functions. Generally these non-protein components are called as cofactors. The cofactors may be either one or more inorganic ions such as Fe2+, Mg2+, Mn2+ and Zn2+ or a complex organic molecules called coenzymes. Some enzymes require both coenzyme and one or more metal ions for their activity. A coenzyme or metal ion that is covalentIy bound to the enzyme protein is called pr,osthetic group. A complete, catalytically active enzyme together with its coenzyme and/ or metal ions is called holoenzyme. The protein part of such an enzyme is called apoenzyme or apoprotein. Coenzymes function as transient carriers of specific functional groups

## Cofactors

Metals are required as cofactors in approximately two thirds of all enzymes. Metalloenzymes contain a definite quantity of functional metal ion that is retained throughout. Metal-activated enzymes bind metals less tightly but require added metals. The distinction between metalloenzymes and metal activated enzymes thus rests on the affini.ty of a particular enzyme for its metal ion. The mechanisms whereby metal ions perform their function appear to be similar both in metallo enzymes and metal activated enzymes. Metals participate through their ability to act as Lewis acids and through chelate formation. Example of a metal functioning as a Lewis acid is the zinc in carbonic anhydrase. The metal can also promote. catalysis by binding substrate at the site of bond cleavage. In carboxypeptidase, the carbonyl oxygen is chelated to the zinc.

## Mechanism of Enzyme Action

A chemical reaction such as A P takes place because a certain fraction of the substrate possesses enough energy to attain an activated condition called the transition state. This transition state is at the top of the energy barrier separating the reactants and products. The rate of a given chemical reaction is proportional to the concentration of this transition state species. The energy of activation is the amount of energy required to bring all the molecules in 1 mole of a substance at a given temperature to the transition state. Enzymes combine transiently with the substrate to produce a transition state intermediate having a lower energy of activation than the uncatalysed reaction. Thus, they accelerate chemical reactions by lowering the energy of activation.

It is generally believed that the catalytic reactions occur in atleast two steps:

- Step 1: A molecule of enzyme(E) and a molecule of substrate(S) collide and react to form an intermediate called the enzyme-substrate complex (E5).
- Step 2: The decomposition of E5 complex to give product(s) and the active enzyme

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The formation of an ES complex affords a lower activation energy.

## Active Site

The functional groups that are essential for the formation of ES complex occur at a specific location on the surface of the enzyme molecule. This section of enzyme where substrate binding and transformation of substrate to product occurs is called as active site. Many attempts have been made to implicate specific amino acid residues (side chain or R groups) as being part of the active site of various enzymes. Some of the amino acids occurring at the active site of enzymes are hydroxyl group of serine, sulfhydryl group of cysteine, imidazole group of histidine and carboxyl group of aspartic acid. Two theories were proposed to explain the mechanism of enzyme action.

## Fischer's Lock and Key Theory (Rigid Template Model)

According to this theory proposed by Emil Fischer during 1890s, the active site possesses a unique conformation which is complementary to the structure of the substrate thus enabling the two molecules to fit together in much the same way as a key fits into a lock. An unfortunate feature of this model is the . . i implied rigidity of the catalytic site.

<!-- image -->

## Koshland's Induced-fit Theory

Koshland had advocated a theory to account for the specificity of enzymes. He postulated that the essential functional groups on the active site of the free enzyme are not in their optimal positions for promoting catalysis. When the substrate molecule is bound by the enzyme the catalytic groups assume a favourable geometrical position to form the transition state. The enzyme molecule is unstable in this active conformation and tends to revert to its free form in the absence of substrate. In the induced fit model, the substrate induces a conformational change in the enzyme which aligns the amino acid residues or other groups for substrate binding, catalysis or both.

## Enzymes Kinetics and Inhibitors

## Factors Mfecting Enzymatic Reaction

The factors that mainly influence any enzyme-catalysed reaction are:

1. Substrate concentration
2. Enzyme concentration
3. Temperature
4. pH
5. Inhibitors

Other factors such as state of enzyme (oxidation), time and activators also affect enzyme-catalysed reaction to certain extent.

## Substrate Concentration

Keeping the factors such as pH, temperature and enzyme concentration at optimum levels, if the substrate concentration is increased, the velocity of the reaction recorded a rectangular hyperbola. At very low substrate concentration the initial reaction velocity (v) is nearly proportional to the substrate concentration (first order kinetics). However, if the substrate concentration is increased the rate of increase slows down (mixed order kinetics). With a further increase in the subsb'ate concentration the reaction rate approaches a constant (zero order-reaction where velocity is independent of substrate concentration).

<!-- image -->

At initial point, eventhough the substrate molecules are present in excess than enzyme on molar basis, not all the enzyme molecules present combine with the

substrate. Hence, increasing the substrate concentration will increase the amount of enzyme associated with substrate as ES and thus reaction will depend on [5]. At Vmax, all the enzyme molecules are saturated with substrate molecules so that further increase in [S] cannot result in increased reaction rate. Michaelis-Menten derived an equation to explain this type of behaviour (Fig. 6.1).

Fig. 6.1 : Michaelis-Menten Curve and Enzyme-Substrate Relationship

<!-- image -->

Let's look at a mathematical model and attempt to generate curve. This was first done by Michaelis and Menten for an equilibrium model. Better is the steady state model of Haldane and Briggs (more general), which we will derive.

For 5 -;.P assume

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

And for initial reaction conditions [P] = 0 &amp; therefore ~ = 0, so have

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Now VI = d[PJI dt = k3[ES] (Note that kcat is often used instead of k3); Assume steady state (steady state assumption: d[ES]/ dt= 0): d[ES]/ dt= 0; Thus: 0 = d[ES]/ dt= kl[E][S] - k2[ES] - k3[ES].

## Enzymes and Kinetics

Continuing we can now substitute for E (free enzyme), because hard to find, and gather constants:

[E] = [Ed- [ES]; then d[ES]/ dt= kl([Etl [S] - [ES][S]) - k2[ES] - k3[ES],

gathering constants:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Now define

Then

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

, w where KM is the Michaelis-Menten constant.

{Note that if k2 » k3 (that IS the equil. of E+S with ES is rapid compared to breakdown of ES to P), then M-M const = 1/(affinity)= the dissociation constant, but only in these special conditions.}

Now a couple of tricks: Solve for [ES]:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

and recall that ~ = Vrnax and therefore VI = k3[ES], and dividing both sides by k3, vI/k3 = [ES]

Substituting: k.g

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

But maximum possible velocity must = k3[Et] = Vmax

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

So, KM+[S] 1 + KMI[S] Which is known as the Michaelis-Menten Equation.

Hence, Michaelis -Menten constant, Km, is defined as the substrate concentration at half maximal velocity and is expressed as mole per litre (Fig. 6.2).

Fig. 6.2 : Graphical Presentation of Michaelis Menten Equation

For simple, one-substrate enzymes then, have Michaelis-Menten Equation as a model for enzyme activity.

## Note predicted consequences of model:

- Note consequences for a plot: start off with approximately linear slope with y = kx. Then at the limit of high concentrations have a horizontal line. This is exactly what we expect if we look at the general form of the

equation:

Turnover Number. The rate constant (First order) for the breakdown of the [ES] complex, kcat (k3), is also known as the turnover number, that is the maximum number of substrate molecules processed/active site (moles substrate/mole active site): kcat=Vrnax / [E}total. Note that this is best determined under saturating conditions. At very low concentrations of [S] can find the second-order rate constant for the conversion of E + S \_E + P: VO = (kcat / KM)([E][S].

## Linear Plots for Enzyme Kinetic Studies

The Michaelis-Menten equation can be algebraically transformed into more useful way to plot the experimental data. Lineweaver and Burk have taken the reciprocal of both [S] and v of the Michaelis-Menten equation to give

Double Reciprocal or Lineweaver-Burke Plot: Need in form: y = ax + b, so take reciprocals of both sides (Fig. 6.4) and have -

Fig. 6.4 : Double Reciprocal curve for Lineweaver-Burke Equation

<!-- image -->

A plot of l/v versus 1/ [5] (the double reciprocal) yields Si straight line. This line intercept X-axis at -l/Km and Y-axis at l/Vmax. The slope of the line is Km/Vmax. The Lineweaver-Burk plot has the great advantage of allowing more accurate determination of Vmax and Km.

## Significance of Km

- i. Km value may vary with substrate.
- ii. An enzyme whose Km is very low will have a high degree of affinity for its substrate (Table 6.2).

Table 6.2: Km Values for some enzyme- substrate systems

| Enzyme                | Substrate                                      | Km (mM)        |

## Enzyme Concentration

When compared to substrate concentration, the concentration of enzyme is always very very low on molar basis. Hence, increasing the enzyme concentration will always increase the reaction rate.

## Temperature

Over a limited range of temperature, the velocity of enzyme-catalysed reactions roughly doubles with a 100C rise in temperature. Enzymes, being proteins, are denatured by heat and become inactive as the temperature increases beyond a certain point. Most of the enzymes are inactivated at temperatures above 600 C. The temperature at which the reaction rate is maximum· is known as optimum temperature.

<!-- image -->

## pH

Most enzymes have a characteristic pH at which their activity is maximum; (Fig. 6.5) above or below this pH, the activity declines. The pH affects the ionic state of the enzyme and frequently that of the substrate also. If a nt:gatively charged enzyme (E-) reacts with a positively charged substrate (SH+), the ESH is formed. At low pH values, E- will be protonated and ESH is not formed. Similarly, at very high pH values SH+ will ionize and lose its positive charge.

Fig. 6.5 : Relationship between pH and Velocity of Enzyme Reaction

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Another important factor is the change in conformation (denaturation) of enzyme at extreme pH values.

## Inhibitors

Some compounds have the ability to combine with certain enzymes but do not serve as substrates and therefore block catalysis. These compounds are called inhibitors. The important type of inhibitors are described below:

## Irreversible Inhibitors

It binds to the enzyme and destroy the active site, or otherwise screw the protein. Suicide inhibitors, a special class of such inhibitors, are activated by the normal catalytic activity of the enzyme, but form an intermediate that binds to and destroys the active site. Irreversible inhibitors bind tightly (often covalently) to the enzyme and cannot be removed by dialysis. They include such things as nerve gases (Sarin, DIPF, Tabun) and insecticides (Malathion).

<!-- image -->

Iodoacetamide is the archetypal enzyme inhibitor: it indiscriminately binds to and deactivates cysteine residues.

Suicide inhibitors generally look like the substrate, but attack the enzyme when activated. S-fluorouracil (which is converted in the body to SF-dUMP) is a suicide inhibitor of thymidylate synthase, and prevents DNA synthesis in cancerous cells.

<!-- image -->

Because suicide inhibitors bind to the active site, the can be used to find what amino acids are present there. Malathion and other organophosphates are suicide inhibitors of insect AChE, so are widely used as insecticides.

## Reversible Inhibitors

Two important subtypes - competitive and non-competitive inhibitors.

## Competitive Inhibitor

In competitive inhibition, both inhibitor and substrate can bind to enzyme and form two independent complexes. Only ES degrades to products: El is considered a 'dead-end'. Because the inhibitor binds, to the active site, the substrate cannot (and vice versa), so there cannot be an ternary ESI complex (Fig. 6.6).

Fig. 6.6 : Models for Competitive Inhibition

<!-- image -->

Any compound which possessess a close structural resemblance to a particular substrate and which competes with that of substrate for the same active site on

## Enzymes and Kinetics

the enzyme is called as competitive inhibitor. The inhibitor is not acted upon by the enzyme and so remains bound to the enzyme preventing the substrate to bind. This is a reversible process. It depends upon the relative concentration of substrate and inhibitor. Competitive inhibition can be completely reversed by addition of large excess of substrate.

The enzyme, succinate dehydrogenase converts succinate to fumarate. For this reaction, malonic acid is a competitive inhibitor as it structurally resembles that of succinate.

## Non-competitive Inhibitor

Non-competitive inhibitors reversibly to somewhere other than the active site; they change the protein conformation allosterically, and reduce the rate at which the enzyme turns over product. They have no effect on Km as the active-site of uninhibited enzyme molecules will only encounter substrate, and no unproductive binding will occur. They do however reduce the apparent Vm; consequently the apparent V m will be reduced, since the protein is no longer as enzymatically competent. Such inhibitors are generally not substrate analogues.

Because the inhibitor can bind independently of the substrate, an ESl complex can also form. Both ESl and El are dead-ends (Fig. 6.7).

Fig. 6.7 : Model for Non-competitive Inhibitors

<!-- image -->

Non-competitive inhibitors bind to a site other than the active site on the enzyme often to deform the enzyme, so that, it does not form the ES complex at its normal rate. Once formed, the ES complex does not decompose at the normal rate to yield products. These effects are not reversed by increasing the substrate concentration.

Some enzymes possessing an essential -SH group are non-competitively inhibited by heavy metal ions (Hg2+, Pb2+). Some metalloenzymes are inhibited non competitively by metal chelating agents like ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA).

Inhibitors are used as tools to probe the mechanism of enzyme catalysed reactions and as therapeutic agents.

## Isoenzyl1lt!S

Enzymes which exist in multiple forms within a single species of organism or even in a single ceH are called isoenzymes or isozymes. Such multiple forms can be detected and separated by gel electrophoresis of cell extracts. Since they are coded by different genes, they differ in amino acid composition and thus in their isoelectric pH values. Lactate dehydrogenase is an example for the isoenzymes which occur as five different forms in the tissues of the human and other vertebrates. All the five isozymes catalyze the same reaction.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

They have the molecular weight of about 134,000 and contain four polypeptides. The five isozymes consist of five different combinations of two different kinds of polypeptides M and H. Kinetic study of lactate dehydrogenase isozymes has revealed that although they catalyze the same reaction, they differ significantly in their Km values for their substrates as well as Vmax values. The two polypeptide chains in LDH are coded by two different genes. Skeletal muscle contains four identical M chains and designated as M4; whereas heart muscle contains four identical H chains and designated as H4. LDH of other tissues are a mixture of the five possible forms H4, H3M, H2M2, HM3 and M4. A determination of the relative amounts of the five LDH isozymes and the total concentration of LDH in a serum sample can provide valuable diagnostic information about which tissues have been damaged and the extent of the damage.

## Enzyme Regulation

Metabolism involves the tight integration of many complex pathways. The regulation of these pathways is mostly achieved by the regulation of enzymes. This is particularly important in major metabolic pathways (glycolysis, Krebs, urea cycle, gluconeogenesis, etc.), which impact important (and energetically expensive) pathways. Enzymes are frequently regulated, in contrast to inorganic catalysts, which generally cannot be regulated. Enzymes that are regulated usually stand at crossroads of metabolic pathways, and have a small kcat (they are slow), so they rarely run quickly enough to catalyse their reactions to equilibrium: Q (mass action ratio, [products] = [reactants] ) = Keq. They often work in pairs, catalysing slightly different reactions in the forward and backwards directions (Fig. 6.8).

## Enzymes and Kinetics

Fig. 6.8 : Model for Enzyme Regulation

<!-- image -->

Phosphofructokinase is often claimed to be the gatekeeper to glycolysis: it is the step that (more-or-less) irrevocably commits fructose-6-phosphate to conversion to pyruvate (and hence to Krebs). Although this may be over-egging the pudding, it is certainly highly regulated and requires ATP. Fructose-1,6-bISphosphatase appears to catalyse the backwards reaction, but this is not quite correct: it converts fructose-1,6-bis-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, but by dephosphorylation: it does not regenerate ATP. This two-enzyme system allows glycolysis and gluconeogenesis to be tightly regulated.

The rate at which regulation can be effectively achieved varies greatly, from hours to microseconds. In approximate order of speed, enzymes may be regulated by:

1. Regulation by genetic expression of enzyme (slowest). There is always competition in a cell between the processes of protein synthesis and protein destruction. By altering these rates, one can alter the whole cell catalytic rate. However, it is rather slow, although proteins with a high turnover rate will respond more quickly.
2. Compartmentation of substrate and enzyme. Enzymes can also be compartmentalised, like the hydrolytic enzymes found in the lysosome, but the release of these suicide enzymes during apoptosis is rather more of an onloff switch than a true regulation.

Fundamentals ofBiochemistnj : A Textbook

3. Activation of a zymogen. Some enzymes are secreted as inactive precursors, called zymogens. Trypsin and pepsin are two such examples: a portion of the zymogen must be cleaved off to form the active enzyme. Again, an on/ off switch more than a tight, variable regulation.
4. Reversible phosphorylation or adenylation. Enzymes can be phosphorylated on their tyrosine, threonine or serine residues. This is a very common regulatory strategy, and a common end-product of a signal cascade.
5. Competitive product inhibition and allosteric regulation (fastest). Many enzymes are inhibited by either their products, or by other chemicals, often those from further down a metabolic pathway. Such enzymes may be 'gatekeepers' to a specific branch of metabolism, and they usually catalyse a true equilibrium reaction, i.e., one that doesn't go to completion (note this is not exactly the same reaction in the forward and backwards directions, so we are not defying the law that states enzymes do not alter the equilibrium point).

There will be looking principally at the last three ways.

In negative feedback, the later or final products of a metabolic sequence feedback negatively on early steps, e.g., in Krebs cycle, the final product of a metabolic sequence feeds-back negatively on early steps (Fig 6.9).

Fig. 6.9 : Negative Feed back Inhibition

<!-- image -->

In positive feedforward, earlier reactants in a metabolic sequence feed-forward positively on later steps. If A is accumulating, it makes sense to speed up downstream reactions to use it up, e.g., fructose-l,6-bisphosphate activates pyruvate kinase in glycolysis. A combination of feedback and feedforward is used to regulate enzyme activity (Fig. 6.10).

However, there is a problem here: it is unlikely that D, A and F are similar to B, so they cannot inhibit by simple competition, and how on earth can an inhibitor positively regulate a reaction anyway? So what happens instead?

The regulation of enzymes by metabolites leads to the concept of allostenc regulation. Allosteric means 'other structure'. Allosteric modulatl)rs can bind at a site other than the active site in question and cause activation or inhibition. These modulators can include the substrate itself, which binds at another active site in a multi-subunit enzyme. In fact, allosterically modulated enzymes almost always have a complex quaternary structure (multiple subunits) and exhibit nonMichaelis-Menten kinetics.

The enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK) is regulated by:

- High concentrations of ATP, which inhibit PFK
- High concentrations of ADP, which stimulate PFK
- High concentrations of AMP, which stimulate PFK
- High concentrations of citrate, which inhibit PFK

Therefore, ATP and citrate are allosteric inhibitors; and ADP and AMP are allosteric activators (Fig. 6.12).

Fig. 6.12: Sigmoidal Curves for Allosteriz Enzyme Regulation

<!-- image -->

Why the sigmoid shape? Allosteric enzymes are multi-subunit enzymes, each with an active site. They show a cooperative response to substrates as well as to modulators, and their affinity for substrate increases with increasing substrate concentration. This means that V increases rapidly over a small range of [5] values, then plateaus off rapidly.

Haemoglobin is a four subunit protein (although it is not an enzyme) that binds oxygen, and is often used as a model for allosteric regulation because it is a good model for cooperation in the binding of multiple ligands. Myoglobin is a closely related monomeric protein. The % saturation with oxygen is equivalent to the saturation of the active site of an enzyme: myoglobin shows normal saturation kinetics; but haemoglobin shows sigmoid kinetics (Fig 6.13).

| Equilibrium constant   | Equation                     |   Value |

02 molecules bind sequentially to Hb with binding constants Kbl to KM, and you can see that each O 2 binds more tightly than the last. The differences in Kb cannot be explained on the basis that each subunit has a different binding constant: if this was the case the subunit with the highest Kb would bind first, in practice it binds last (Fig. 6.14).

Fig. 6.14 : 02 Affinity Curves for Haemoglobin (Hb)

Oxygen binds to the most difficult site first. This alters the conformation of the protein so the next subunit binds oxygen more easily. This process is then repeated for the other two subunits. This change in conformation caused by the progressive binding of a ligand is known as cooperatitrity and leads to sigmoid kinetics. The binding of one ligand (substrate or modulator) changes the conformation of the protein. This can increase or decrease the affinity for further ligands. There are two models for this cooperativity:

- Concerted model (Wyman, Monod &amp; Changeux).
- Sequential model (Koshland).

Both models recognise that subunits change their conformation and alter the binding constant (Kb) for ligands. The low affinity form is known as tense (T).

The high affinity form is relaxed (R), and these exist in equilibrium with each other.

In the sequential model, each binding of substrate increases the affinity of the other active sites (Fig 6.15).

Fig. 6.15: Sequential Model for Enzyme substrate Affinity

<!-- image -->

In the concerted model, the first binding of substrate increases the affinity of the other active sites, but further bindings have no effect. This doesn't contradict the haemoglobin/ oxygen binding constants presented earlier, as the increased affinities at ever increasing oxygen concentrations could be due to the increased proportion of relaxed form, rather than to individual increases in each protein molecule (Fig. 6.16).

Fig. 6.16 : Concerted Model for Enzymes-substrate Affinity

<!-- image -->

The currently accepted model for allosteric inhibitors and activators is based on the concerted model. Inhibitors lock all subunits in the tense form, whereas activators locks all subunits in the relaxed form.

In allosteric inhibition, the inhibitor locks the enzyme in the tense conformation. Binding of substrate (when sufficiently little inhibitor is present) locks the enzyme in the relaxed form (Fig. 6.17).

Fig. 6.17 : Allosteric Inhibition

<!-- image -->

In allosteric activation, the activator locks the enzyme in the relaxed conformation (Fig. 6.18).

Fig. 6.18: Allosteric Activation

<!-- image -->

There is some vocabulary you should know for cooperativity:

- Positive: one molecule facilitates the binding of another.
- Negative: one molecule makes the binding of another more difficult.
- Homotropic: one molecule influences the binding of a second similar molecule.
- Heterotropic: one molecule influences the binding of a different molecule.

A typical allosteric inhibitor therefore cooperates in a heterotropic, negative fashion.

Phosphorylation is another very common way of regulating enzymes, especially in signalling cascades. It requires ATP. A frequently quoted example is glycogen phosphorylase, an enzyme that phosphorylates glycogen, and is itself most active when phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase is reversible and controlled by the phosphorylase kinase and a phosphatase. (kinases add phosphate groups to proteins, phosphatases remove them). The phosphorylase kinase is itself regulated by phosphorylation (Fig. 6.19).

## The regulation is rather complex:

## Give Answer in brief

## Q-l What is the importance of enzymes in living systems?

- A-l Enzymes are the reaction catalysts of the biological systems. They have extraordinary catalytic power, often greater than that of synthetic catalysts. They have high degree of substrate specificity &amp; accelerate specific chemical reactions. They function in an aqueous medium under very mild

## Enzymes and Kinetics

Protein kinases like glycogen-phosphorylase kinase act on specific amino-acid sequences, called consensus sequences. Protein-kinase-a acts on the serine/threonine residue in the sequence X-arg-arg/lys-X-ser/thr-asx. Cyc1independent-kinase-2 acts on the same residues in the sequence X-ser/thr-pro-Xlys/ arg. Only the alcoholic amino acids serine, threonine and tyrosine can be phosphorylated.

Zymogens are the final way of regulating enzymes. Zymogens are inactive enzyme precursors. They are activated by external means, and undergo cleavage to produce an active enzyme. Digestive enzymes are mostly regulated in this way, because we don't want them to digest the cell that synthesises them! e.g., Pepsin is activated by H+ in the stomach. Trypsin and chymotrypsin follow a more complex scheme (Fig. 6.20).

## QUIZ

- conditions of temperature&amp; pH. Very few non-biological catalysts show all these properties.

## Q-2 If enzymes are not present in body what will happen?

- A-2 The biochemical reactions taking place in living cells at body temperature at sufficiently rapid in a regular order. Such reactions would have been extremely slow, had they not been catalyzed by enzymes, which are present in every living cell and can also act independently of the cell. (e.g. hydrolysis of starch by salivary amylase).
- Q-3 Were enzyme actions were known in earlier time?
- A-3 Yes, Biological catalysis was first recognized &amp; described in the early 1800 in studies of digestion of meat by secretions of stomach &amp; conversion of starch into sugar by saliva &amp; various plant extracts. In 1850 Louise Pasteur concluded that fermentation of sugar into alcohol by yeast is catalyzed by" FERMENTS "&amp; later named than enzymes, are inseparable from living yeast cells, a view that prevailed for many years.
- Q-4 What was Buchner's important discovery regarding enzyme? (Or fermentation?) .
- A-4 In 1897 Buchner showed yeast extract (cell free) could ferment sugar to alcohol. This encouraged biochemists to attempt the isolation of many different enzymes &amp; to examine their catalytic properties.
- Q-S What was the important discovery made by J ames Sumner?
- A-S In 1926 James Sumner crystallized UREASE and found it is as a protein and postulated that all enzymes are proteins. This idea remained controversial for some time.
- Q-6 What was contribution of J. B. S. HALDANE regarding enzyme?
- A-6 During the period 1930, J. B. S. HALDANE wrote a treatise entitled enzymes, even though molecular nature of enzymes was not fully yet appreciated. It contained remarkable suggestions of weak bonding interactions and substrate catalyzed reaction.

## Q-7 What is an enzyme?

- A-7 Enzymes are the reaction catalysts of the biological systems. They are protein in nature (With exception of small group of catalytic RNA molecules). Molecular weight ranges from 12000 to over million. They are specific in action e.g. Urease. Their catalytic activity depends upon the integrity of their native protein conformation. If enzyme is denatured or dissociated into subunits catalytically activity is usually lost. The enzymes carry out transformation of molecules and also mediate transformation of energy e.g. PHOTOSYNTHESIS.

## Q-8 What are simple and complex enzymes?

- A-8 Some enzymes require no chemical groups other than amino acids for activity, Enzymes composed of only protein are known as simple enzymes.

- Complex enzyme composed of protein plus a relatively small organic molecule, which is required for enzyme activity.
- Q-9 What is apo-enzyme?
- A-9 Apo-enzyme is the protein part of an enzyme without any cofactors or prosthetic group that may be required for the enzyme to be functional. The apo-enzyme is catalytically inactive.
- Q-IO What is coenzyme or prosthetic group?
- A-IO A non-protein component of an enzyme, which is required for catalytic activity, is known as co-enzyme or prosthetic group.
- Q-ll What is co-factor?
- A-ll Is small organic or inorganic molecules that an apo-enzyme requires for its activity. e.g. in lysine oxidase, copper is loosely bound which act as cofactor.
- Q-12 What is the difference between prosthetic group and co-enzyme?
- A-12 A coenzyme or metal ion that is covalently bound to the enzyme protein is called prosthetic group. For e.g. in the cytochromes, the haeme prosthetic group is very tightly bound and requires strong acids to dissociate from its apoenzyme.
- Q-13 Do some Enzymes contain vitamin derivatives?
- A-12 Yes, Many prosthetic groups and coenzymes are water-soluble derivatives of vitamins. It should be noted that the main clinical symptoms of dietary vitamin insufficiency generally arise from the malfunction of enzymes, which lack sufficient cofactors derived from vitamins to maintain homeostasis.
- Q-14 What is a holo enzyme?
- A-13 A complete catalytically active enzyme together with its coenzyme and/ or metal ions called a holoenzyme. Apo-enzyme + Co enzyme == Holoenzyme.
- Q-14 What is metalloenzyme and metal activated enzymes?
- A-14 Enzymes require a metal in their composition (such as Fe+2,Mg2+. Mn2+,Zn2+ ) are known as metalloenzymes. If they bind and retain their metal atom(s) under all conditions, that is with very high affinity. Those, which have a lower affinity for metal ion, but still require the metal ion for activity, are known as metal-activated enzymes.

## Q-15 How enzymes are named?

- A-IS Many enzymes have been named by adding the suffix "-ase" to the name of their substrate or to a word or phrase describing their activity. e.g. UREASE catalyze hydrolysis of urea, MALTASE act on maltose, and DNA polymerase catalyze the synthesis of DNA. Other enzymes such as PEPSIN and TRYPSIN have names they do not denote their substrates.

## Q-16 What is IUB system?

- A-16 Sometimes the enzyme may have two or more names, or two different enzymes have the same name. Because of such ambiguities, and ever increasing number of newly discovered enzymes a system for naming and classifying enzymes has been adopted by inter national agreement, International Union of Biochemistry (IUB-system)

## Q-17 How enzymes are classified according to IUB system?

- A-17 According to IUB system enzymes are grouped in six major classes. Each with sub classes based on the type of reaction catalyzed. Systemic classification of enzymes based on numbering system is used. Each enzyme is assigned a code number or EC (enzyme commission number) four-digit classification number and a systematic name, which identifies the reaction catalyzed.

## Q-18 According to IUB system which enzymes are included in group 1? A-18 OXIDO-REDUCTASE (EC-l)

Enzymes of this group add or remove hydrogen atoms during the catalysis. They include dehyrogenases &amp; oxidases, and are mostly concerned with biological oxidation.

Dehydrogenases removes H+ from substrate in the presence of H+ acceptor group. e.g. Lactate Dehydrogenase. Enzymatic action can be represented by:

AH2 + B -------a A + BH2

OXIDASES -transfer two electrons from the donor to oxygen resulting usually in hydrogen peroxide formation (H202) e.g. Glucose oxidase. CYTOCHROME oxidase produces H20 rather than H202. Oxygenases catalyze the incorporation of oxygen into a substrate.

## Vitamins and Coenzymes

Vitamins are low molecular weight organic compounds required in small amounts in the diet. Most of the vitamins are not synthesized in the human body but are synthesized by the plants. Hence these essential nutrients are mainly obtained through the food. Though most of them are present in the diet as such, some are present as precursors known as provitamins.

Vitamins are divided into two major categories. They are fat-soluble (A, D, E and K) and water-soluble vitamins (B-complex and vitamin C). B complex vitamins include thiamine (Bl ), riboflavin (B2), pantothenic acid (B3), niacin (Bs), pyridoxine (B6), biotin (B7), folic acid (B9), and cobalamin (B12). Inositol, cholic and para-aminobenzoic acid are vitamin-like substances sometimes classified as part of the B complex, but no convincing evidence has been shown so far to be included as vitamins. All the fat-soluble vitamins and some B vitamins exist in multiple forms. The active forms of vitamin A are retinol, retinal and retinoic acid and vitamin D is available as ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3). The vitamin E family includes four tocopherols and four tocotrienols but utocopherol being the most abundant and active form. The multiple forms of vitamins are interconvertible and some are interchangeable.

## Fat-Soluble Vitamins

The fat-soluble vitamins are soluble in fat and other nonpolar solvents. All are synthesized fully or partly from isoprene units and excess quantities are stored in fat containing cells. The fat-soluble vitamins appear not to function as components of coenzymes but to serve other important roles. The important dietary sources, functions and deficient diseases associated with fat- soluble vitamins are given in Table 7.1.

## Coenzymes

## Mechanism of Coenzyme Action

Coenzyme accelerates the enzymatic reaction by helping the formation of the product (s) by acting as acceptor for one of the products.

The substrate combines with the apoenzyme to form activated complex. But this combination takes place in the presence of coenzyme. The bond in the substrate is strained and ruptured when one of the cleavage products is directly transferred to the coenzyme, which has suitable receptor site in its structure. The other cleavage product now dissociates from the apoenzyme liberating the enzyme protein for fresh reaction. The cleavage product attached to the coenzyme is next released from the surface of the coenzyme after the completion of enzyme action. Now both apoenzyme and coenzyme are regenerated to their original form and are ready for fresh reaction. A prosthetic group also acts in a similar fashion with the difference that the prosthetic group is firmly attached to the surface of the apoenzyme.

The structure and coenzyme functions of B-complex group vitamins are described below.

## Thiamine

The two important reactions in which TPP functions as coenzyme are:

- Oxidative decarboxylation of a-keto acids such as pyruvate and a -ketoglutarate.
- Transketolase reaction.

TPP provides a reactive carbon on the thiazole ring and forms a carbanion stabilized by positively charged ring nitrogen. The carbanion is then free to add

the carbonyl carbon of pyruvate (or a-ketoglutarate). The addition compound is then decarboxylated eliminating C02 and generating hydroxyethyl-TPP. This reaction occurs in a multienzyme complex known as pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (or a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex). The acetaldehyde (decarboxylated product) moiety is then transferred to the lipoamide in the complex.

The role of TPP as a coenzyme in the transketolase reaction is very similar to that of oxidative decarboxylation. The carbanion of TPP combines with the carbonyl carbon of xylulose 5P. Carbon 1 and 2 of xylulose 5P are retained to form hydroxyethyl derivative of TPP. Then it is transferred to the carbonyl carbon of ribose 5P to form sedoheptulose 7P.

## Riboflavin

The flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are the two-coenzyme forms of riboflavin.

FMN and FAD serve as prosthetic groups of oxidation-reduction enzymes known as flavoenzymes or flavoproteins. They are usually tightly, but not covalently, bound to the protein. Many flavoproteins contain one or more metals as additional cofactors and are known as the metalloflavoproteins. In the catalytic cycle of flavoproteins the flavin moiety of the flavin nucleotides undergoes reversible reduction of the isoalloxazine ring to yield the reduced nucleotides FMNH2 and F ADH2. L-amino acid oxidase contains tightly bound FMN as the prosthetic group. Succinate dehydrogenase and D-amino acid oxidase contain FAD as prosthetic group.

## Niacin

The coenzyme forms of niacin are NAD+ and NADP+ which function as the coenzymes of a large number of oxidoreductases collectively called as pyridine-linked dehydrogenases. These coenzymes are bound to the dehydrogenase protein relatively loosely during the catalytic cycle and therefore serve as substrate than as prosthetic group. They function as electron acceptors during the enzymatic removal of hydrogen atoms from specific substrate molecules. One hydrogen atom from the substrate is transferred as a hydride ion to the nicotinamide portion of the oxidised forms of these coenzymes. The other hydrogen atom from the substrate becomes a hydrogen ion (Figure 8.5). Pyridine linked dehydrogenases are specific for either NAD+ or NADP+, but a few will function with both. Isocitrate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase are NAD-specific. Glucose 6-P dehydrogenase is NADP-specific. Glutamate dehydrogenase functions with NAD+ or NADP+.

## Pyridoxine

The coenzyme form of pyridoxine is known as pyridoxal phosphate (PP) The most common type of reaction requiring PP as a coenzyme is transamination. Enzymes catalysing such reactions are known as transaminases or aminotransferases. The coenzyme binds to its apoenzyme via Schiff's base between its aldehyde group and the epsilon amino group of a lysine in the

VO

enzyme. Additional ionic bond is also formed between its phosphate and the enzyme. During reaction, a-amino group of amino acid displaces the epsilon amino group forming a new Schiff's base. By a series of electron shifts and rearrangements, the pyridoxal phosphate becomes pyridoxamine phosphate. The amino acid is oxidatively deaminated to form the corresponding a-keto acid. The a-amino group is then transferred to a new a-keto acid to change it to an amino acid. pp also acts as coenzyme in the decarboxylation, desulphuration, transulphuration reactions associated with amino acid metabolism.

## Pantothenic Acid

The coenzyme form of pantothenic acid is coenzyme A and is represented as CoASH. The thiol group (-SH) acts as a carrier of acyl group. The acyl-sulphur bond formed between coenzyme A and the acyl moiety is a high-energy bond, equivalent to the high-energy bond of ATP. The function of coenzyme A is to serve as a carrier of acyl group in reactions associated with fatty acid oxidation, fatty acid synthesis, pyruvate oxidation and biological acetylations. It is also involved in many biosynthetic processes such. as synthesis of cholesterol, terpenes and steroids.

## Biotin

The important of biotin is its role as co enzyme for carboxylase, which catalyses carbon dioxide fixation or carboxylation reaction. The epsilon amino group of lysine in carboxylase enzymes combines with the carboxyl group of biotin to form covalently linked biotinyl carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP or biocytin) (Figure 6.8). This serves as an intermediate carrier of carbon dioxide. The carboxylation of acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA in presence of acetyl CoA carboxylase requires biotin as coenzyme. Propionyl carboxylase and pyruvate carboxylase are also associated with biotin.

## Folic Acid

The coenzyme form of folic acid is tetra hydro folic acid (Figure 6.9). Tetrahydro folic acid is associated with one carbon metabolism. The tetrahydro folic acid serves as a carrier of single carbon moieties such as formyl, methenyl, methylene, formyl or methyl group. (Figure 6.10). It is involved in the biosynthesis of purines, pyrimidines, serine, methionine and glycine.

## Lipoic Acid

The oxidispd and reduced forms of lipoic acid are given in figure 6.11. Lipoic acid functions as a coenzyme in pyruvate and a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes.

## Cobalamin

The 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin and methyl cobalamin function as coenzyme forms and are required for the action of several enzymes. Methyl malonyl CoA mutase uses 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin as coenzyme. Methyl cobalamin functions as a carrier of methyl group to homocysteine and convert it to methionine

## Fundamentals ofBiochemistnj : A Textbook

Vitamins are classified as fat-soluble and water-soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins include vitamins A, D, E and K. B-complex group and vitamin C belong to water-soluble vitamins. B-complex group of vitamins function as coenzymes and play a key role in biochemical reactions. The coenzyme form. of thiamine is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). It is associated with oxidative decarboxylation of a-keto acids such as pyruvate and a-ketoglutarate as well as transketolase enzyme. The carbanion formed in the thiazole ring of TPP condenses with the carbonyl carbon -pyruvate and then decarboxylation occurs. The flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adnine dinucleotide (FAD) are the two coenzymes forms of riboflavin. FMV and FAD serve as coenzymes for contain and oxidation reaction and under reversible reduction of the isoalloxazine ring to yield FMNH2 and F ADH2. The coenzyme forms of niacin are NAD+ and NADP+, which function as the coenzymes for a large number of oxidoreductases. They function as electron acceptors. One hydrogen atom from the substrate is transferred as a hydride ion to the nicotinamide portion of the oxidized forms of these coenzymes. The coenzyme form of pyridoxine is pyridoxal phosphate. It function as coenzyme in transamination reaction as well as decarboxylation, desulphuration reaction in amino acid metabolism.

The coenzyme form of pantothenic acid is coenzyme A and is represented as Co ASH. The thiol group acts as a carrier of acyl group. It is an important coenzyme involved in fatty acid oxidation, pyruvate oxidation and is also biosynthesis of terpenes. The epsilon amino group of lysine in carboxylase enzymes combines with the carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP or biocytin) and serve as an intermediate carrier of C02. Acetyl CoA pyruvate and propionyl carboxylayse require the participation of BCCP. The coenzyme form of folic acid is tetrahydro folic acid. It is associated with one carbon metabolism. The oxidised and reduced forms of lipoic acid function as coenzyme in pyruvate and aketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes. The 5-deoxy adenosyl and methyl cobalamins function as coenzyme forms of vitamin B12. Methyl cobalamin is involved in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine.

## QUIZ

## Give Answer in brief Q-l What are vitamins? A-I

- Vitamins are organic compounds found in foods and are essential in small quantities for the normal health and growth of the body.
- The distinguishing feature of the vitamins is that they generally cannot be synthesized by mammalian cells and, therefore, must be supplied in the diet.

## Vitamins and Coenzymes

- The most prominent function is as cofactors for enzymatic reactions.
- There are thirteen organic compounds known to function as vitamins in humans.
- Vitamins are classified into two categories: Fat-soluble Vitamins (A, D, E, K) and Water-soluble Vitamins (All B, Biotin, Folic acid and Ascorbic acid).
- There is minimal tissue storage of water soluble vitamins in the body, therefore, water soluble vitamins are less likely to accumulate to toxic levels than are fat-soluble vitamins. In the case of an overdose of vitamins, fat-soluble vitamins are potentially more toxic than water-soluble vitamins.
- The absence of one or more vitamins from the diet or poor absorption of vitamins can cause vitamin deficiency diseases.

## Fat soluble vitamins

## Q-2 Describe pro and active forms of Vitamin A.

- A-2 Vitamin A consists of three biologically active molecules, retinol, retinal (retinaldehyde) and retinoic acid. Each of these compounds are derived from a group of molecules know as carotenoids also referred to as the provitamin A. Beta-carotene, which consists of two molecules of retinal linked at their aldehyde ends.
- Q-3 Describe in brief, physico-chemical properties of Vitamin A.
- A-3 It is a yellow color oil, insoluble in water but soluble in alcohol, chloroform etc. It consists of beta ionone ring with side chain of long chain unsaturated alcohol. It is unstable in the presence of heat, light, acid and oxidation while stable in alkaline media and also upon reduction.

## Q-4 Describe absorption, storage and transport of Vitamin A.

A-4

- Ingested beta-carotene is cleaved in the lumen of the intestine by betacarotene dioxygerzase to yield retinal.
- Retinal is reduced to retinol by reUnaldehyde reductase, an NADPH requiring enzyme within the intestines.
- Retinol esters present in the diet are hydrolyzed in the intestinal mucosa, releasing retinal and free fatty acids.
- Retinol is esterified to palmitic acid in the intestinal mucosa and secreted as components of chylomicrons into the lymphatic system and through blood stored in liver.
- The uptake of chylomicron remnants by the liver results in delivery of retinol to this organ for storage as a lipid ester within lipocytes.
- Transport of retinol from the liver to extra-hepatic tissues occurs by binding of hydrolyzed retinol to retinol binding protein (RBP).

Fundamentals ofBiochemistn) : A Textbook

- The retinol-RBP complex is then transported to the cell surface within the Golgi and secreted.
- Within extra hepatic tissues retinol is bound to cellular retinol binding protein (CRBP).
- Plasma transport of retinoic acid is accomplished by binding to albumin. Zinc is required for mobilization of vit. A from liver.
- About 95% of vitamin A is stored as its palmitate ester in the liver. It is released in plasma as and when required.

## Q-6 Describe the role of vitamin A in vision: A-6

- The molecular mechanism through which vitamin A functions in visual system is known as Rhodopsin cycle or Wald's visual cycle for which George Wald was awarded Nobel Prize.
- Photoreception in the eye is the function of two specialized cell types located in the retina; the rod and cone cells. Rod cells are sensitive and function in dim illumination, are concentrated around the periphery of the retina are about 100 million cells.
- Both rod and cone cells contain a photoreceptor pigment in their membranes.
- The photosensitive compound of most mammalian eyes is a protein called opsin to which is covalently coupled an aldehyde of vitamin A, and is called rhodopsin or visual purple.
- This compound is a complex between opsin and the ll-cis-retinal (also called ll-cis-retinene) form of vitamin A.

## Vitamins and Coenzymes

- It is sensitive to light and when illuminated, it changes from red to orapge yellow, and on prolonged exposure, to colorless retinal and opsin.
- This process triggers a nerve impulse that is transmitted by the optic nerve to brain.
- On exposure to light this gets bleached and is converted to all-trans-retinal (visual yellow) and opsin.
- In the dark rhodopsin is regenerated and sensitivity of the retina is restored. (Dark adaptation)
- Light, especially short wavelengths, isomerizes trans retinine to the cis form. This reaction is slow.
- An enzyme in the retina specially and rapidly (especially in dim light) catalyzes the conversion of all trans retinene to 11-cis retinene (neo-b retinine), by the enzyme retinene isomerase.
- 11-cis-retinal then combines spontaneously with opsin in the dark to form rhodopsin, thus completing the cycle.
- It is important to note that all-trans-retinal is incompletely converted to 11cis-retinal; hence a constant supply of vitamin A is needed in the diet.
- Q-7 Describe other functions of vitamin A, besides visual cycle.

A-7

Growth: Vitamin A helps in the formation of chondritin sulfate in cartilage. In absence of Vitamin A, animal fails to grow, bone growth is slow.

Anemia: Vitamin A deficiency can lead to anemia caused by impaired mobilization of iron from the liver because vitamin A is required for the synthesis of iron transport protein transferin.

Bone and Teeth: Deiective formation of enamel of teeth. Abnormal bone and tooth formation are reversed by vitamin A administration.

Carbohydrate metabolism: Vitamin A helps glucose synthesis from triose molecules. Reproduction: Retinol and retinal are essential for normal reproduction.

Urolithiasis: In vitamin A deficiency, urino-genital epithelium shows keratinization followed by bacterial invasion and formation of alkaline urine. This factors cause calcium phosphate precipitation, which leads to formation of urinary calculi.

Xeropthalmia: Xeropthalmia is an eye disease characterized by drying of the eyes. The cells of lachrymal glands become keratinized and stops secreting tears hence the bacteria are not washed away. The external surface of cornea becomes dry with dull appearance. The eyelids, swells and becomes sticky and there will be severe eye infection. Ulcers may develop and if not treated in time blindness results. Less severe sub clinical

symptoms frequently found in human beings is night blindness. or nyctalopia, inability to see in dim light or to adopt to decrease intensity of light.

Cancer: The increased risk of cancer in vitamin deficiency is thought to be the result of depletion in beta-carotene. Beta-carotene is a very effective antioxidant and is suspected to reduce the risk of cancer is known to be initiated, by the production of free radicals. Of particular interest is the potential benefit of increased b-carotene intake to reduce the risk of lung cancer in smokers. However, caution needs to be taken when increasing the intake of any of the lipid soluble vitamins.

## Q-8 List Vitamin A Toxicity manifestations.

A-8

- Fatigue insomnia, irritability, nausea, diarrhea are observed
- Nerve lesion, painful bone &amp; joints
- Abnormal bone growth
- Loss of hair . L Liver is enlarged and becomes cirrhotic
- Decrease in blood clotting time.
- Q-9 Vitamin D is structurally related to which compound?
- A-9 Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin (acts as a steroid hormone) and is structurally related to a group of steroids that occur mainly in animals (cholecalciferol) but also in plants and yeasts (ergosterol).
- Q-IO How cholesterol is structurally related to vitamin D?
- A-ID Provitamin D is a simple derivative of cholesterol, which occurs when a hydrogen is removed from the number 7 carbon, which then forms a double bond with the number 8 carbon, in the second, or 'B' ring of the cholesterol molecule.
- The cholesterol is 'oxidized' (that is, an electron is removed with the hydrogen atom), so that the double bond is a consequence of 2 mutually shared elech·ons between carbons 7 and 8.
- Q-ll What is the structural difference between pro-vitamin D (7-dehydro cholesterol) in the skin and ergosterol?
- A-ll Ergosterol and pro-vitamin D, 7-dehydrocholesterol, in the skin have the same structure except ergosterol has one more double bond in the side chain between C22 and C23 and has one more methyl group at C24. Both the provitamin D and ergosterol are converted to active vitamin D by DV radiation.
- Q-12 How vitamin D2 and D3 are named as?
- A-12 Vitamin D2 is of vegetable origin called as Ergocalciferol. Vitamin D3 is of animal origin known as cholecalciferol.

## Vitamins and Coenzymes

## Q-12 How vitamin D is absorbed and transported?

- A-12 Cholecalciferol (or Ergocalciferol) is absorbed from the intestinal tract and requires the presence of bile salts, after absorption it is transported to the liver bound to a specific vitamin D-binding protein (alpha-2 globulin).

## Q-13 How Vitamin D is activated to its biologically active form? A-13

- After absorption vitamin D2 and D3 are transported to liver bound to alpha-2 globulin but are not biologically active.
- They are converted to active form by two sequential hydroxylation reactions.
- The first hydroxylation occurs at the 25-position and is catalyzed by specific mitochondrial hydroxylase in the liver.
- The product of the reaction 25-hydroxycholecalciferol or 25 -OH D3 is the predominant form of vitamin D in the plasma and is the major form in which vitamin D is stored.
- Liver 25-hydroxylase does not hav.e any specific regulatory mechanism and hence the 25-hydroxy D level is dependent upon vitamin D intake and the extent to which skin is exposed to sunlight.
- 25-0H D3 is further hydroxylated at I-position by a specific 25-0Hcholecalciferol I-hydroxylase enzyme, primarily present in the proximal convoluted tubules of kidney, forming 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (DHCC) with the help of cytochromP-450, molecular oxygen &amp; NADPH.
- 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, or active Vitamin D, contains three hydroxyl groups at 1, 3 and 25 positions. So it is called calcitriol and it is biologically active form of vitamin D.
- Vitamin D2 and D3 are processed to D2-calcitriol and D3-calcitriol, respectively by the same enzymatic pathways in the body.
- This I-hydroxylase enzyme is controlled by parathyroid hormone (PTH), and by calcium and phosphate concentrations in the blood, as well as by feedback regulation from the active form of the vitamin.
- Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) is the biologically active form of Vitamin D, and it is transported in the bloodstream to its major sites of action: intestine, kidney and bone tissue.

## Q-14 What is the mode of action of Vitamin D? A-14

- Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that functions to regulate specific gene expression following interaction with its intracellular receptor.
- Calcitriol binds to a cytoplasmic receptor.

Fundamentals ofBiochemistnJ : A Textbook

- The hormone-receptor complex interacts with DNA and causes transcription of specific genes that code for a specific calcium binding protein, calbindin.
- Due to the increased availability of calcium binding protein, the absorption of calcium is increased.
- The increased absorption of calcium ions requires concomitant absorption of a negatively charged counter ion to maintain electrical neutrality; the predominant counter ion is phosphate.
- Calcitriol functions in concert with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin to regulate serum calcium and phosphorous levels.

## Q-IS Discuss functions of vitamin D. A-IS

- Increases protein synthesis in intestinal cells.
- Activates active transport of calcium by intestinal cells.
- Increases release of calcium by mitochondria.
- Promotes normal bone calcification.
- Regulates phosphorus and calcium metabolism.
- Increases renal tubular reabsorption of calcium.
- It does not have any coenzyme activity.

## Q-16 Discuss the role of vitamin D in regulating calcium and phosphorus levels in body.

## A-16

- Active calcitriol stimulates production of calcium binding protein in the mucosal cells of intestine, which helps of more calcium.
- The two primary stimuli for increasing activity of I-hydroxylase in the kidney are low levels of calcium and phosphorus.
- Low serum phosphate level directly stimulates the enzyme I-hydroxylase.
- Low serum calcium level indirectly stimulates the enzyme I-hydroxylase, viaPTH.
- Low serum calcium ion stimulates parathyroid glands to secrete PTH, which in turn stimulates I-hydroxylase and inhibits 24-hydroxylase reactions in kidney.
- PTH is released in response to low serum calcium and induces the production of calcitriol. In contrast, reduced levels of PTH stimulate synthesis of the inactive 24,2S-(OH)2D3.
- When plasma calcium level falls the major sites of action of calcitriol and PTH are bone where they stimulate bone resorption and the kidneys where they inhibit calcium excretion by stimulating reabsorption by the distal tubules.

## Vitamins and Coenzymes

- At the same time it prevents reabsorption of phosphate by kidney and phosphate is excreted in the urine.
- Feed back inhibition of l-hydroxylase occurs, once the hypocalcaemia and hypophosphatemia is corrected.
- Corticosteroids stimulate the conversion of vitamin D to its inactive metabolite and have been shown to cause bone demineralization when used for long period of time.
- Q-17 How is Vitamin D deficiency manifested? Or Clinical Significance of Vitamin D Deficiency.

## A-17

- As a result of the addition of vitamin D to milk, deficiencies in this vitamin are rare.
- The main symptom of vitamin D deficiency in children is rickets and in adults is osteomalacia.
- Rickets is characterized improper mineralization during the development of the bones resulting in soft, pliable bones.
- Renal rickets (renal osteodystrophy) results from chronic renal failure where decreased ability to from active from of vitamin D.
- In adults, osteqmalacia is a condition of defective new bone mineralization in the adult skeleton due to Vitamin D deficiency.
- Osteomalacia is characterized by demineralization of previously formed bone leading to increased softness and susceptibility to fracture.

## Q-18 Describe sources and daily requirement of vitamin D. A-18

- Good sources: Fish liver oil (Tuna, Cod, Halibut and shark).
- Medium sources: Egg yolk, margarine, lard, shrimps and sardine.
- Low sources: grain and vegetable oils, butter, cream, cheese, milk, meat, beef.
- The cheapest source is sunlight, which converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D in the skin.
- The daily requirement of an adult is 200 IV and that of children and women during pregnancy and lactation is 400 ID. One IV= 0.025 mcg of vitamin D3.

## Q-19 Write a short note on hypervitaminosis D.

- A-19 Vitamin D is most toxic of all vitamins stored in the body. It is slowly metabolized. Extremely large amounts (500-1000times RD) cause hypervitaminosis D. The clinical manifestations are:
- Anorexia, thirst, constipation and polyuria.
- This is followed by nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
- Hyperphosphatemia also occurs.

Fundamentals ofBiochemistnj : A Textbook

- Hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphatemia may lead to metastatic calcification. l'he, kidney, arteries, muscles and gastric mucosa are mainly involved.
- Increased urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate Play lead to urinary lithiasis.
- The renal failure leads to death.

## Q-20 What is Vitamin E? Discuss its role in the body.

- A-20 Vitamin E is a mixture of several related compounds known as tocopherols.
- The a-tocopherol molecule is the most potent of the tocopherols. The active form of Vitamin E is alpha-tocopherol.
- Vitamin E is absorbed from the intestines packaged in chylomicrons. It is delivered to the tissues via chylomicron transport and then to the liver through chylomicron remnant uptake. The liver can export vitamin E in VLDLs.
- Due to its lipophilic nature, vitamin E accumulates in cellular membranes, fat deposits and other circulating lipoproteins.
- The major site of vitamin E storage is in adipose tissue.
- Vitamin E is necessary for normal reproduction, muscular development and resistance of erythrocytes to hemolysis.
- The major function of vitamin E is to act as a natural antioxidant by scavenging free radicals and molecular oxygen. In particular vitamin E is important for preventing peroxidation of polyunsaturated membrane fatty acids.
- The vitamins E and C are interrelated in their antioxidant capabilities.
- Active a-tocopherol can be regenerated by interaction with vitamin C following scavenge of a peroxy free radical. Alternatively, a-tocopherol can scavenge two peroxy free radicals and then be conjugated to glucuronate for excretion in the bile.
- It acts synergistically with selenium as an anti-oxidant.

## Q-21 Describe clinical manifestations of Vitamin E deficiency.

## A-21

- No major disease states have been found to be associated with vitamin E deficiency due to adequate levels in the average diet.
- The major symptom of vitamin E deficiency in humans is an increase in red blood cell fragility.
- Since vitamin E is absorbed from the intestines in chylomicrons, any fat malabsorption diseases can lead to deficiencies in vitamin E intake.
- Neurological disorders have been associated with vitamin E deficiencies associated with fat mal absorptive disorders.

## Vitamins and Coenzymes

- Increaseq,intake of vitamin E is recommended in premature infants fed form:ulas that are low in the vitamin as well as in persons consuming a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids.
- ,. Polyunsaturated fatty acids tend to form free radicals· upon exposure to oxygen and this may lead to an increased risk of certain cancers.
- Deficiency can also lead to degeneration of the central nervous system.

## Q-22 What are the dietary sources and daily requirement of Vitamin E? A-22

- Vegetable oils are rich sources of Vitamin E, e.g. wheat germ oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, cottonseed oil, and palm oil.
- Sources of Vitamin E are found in vegetables, fruits, liver &amp; eggs. Over 60% of dietary Vitamin E comes from vegetable oil.
- Daily requirement of vitamin E is about 15 mg or 33 international units.
- One mg of d-a-tocopherol acetate is equal to one ID.

## Q-23 Describe briefly the structure of Vitamin K and its biochemical role.

## A-23

- The K vitamins exist naturally as Kl (phytylmenaquinone) in green vegetables and K2 (multiprenylmenaquinone) in intestinal bacteria and I&lt;J is synthetic menadione. They are naphthoquinone derivatives.
- Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin, which is stored in the liver. It plays a role in the complicated process of blood clotting.
- The major function of the K vitamins is in the maintenance of normal levels of the blood clotting proteins, factors II, VII, IX, X and protein C and protein S, which are synthesized in the liver as inactive precursor proteins.
- Conversion from inactive to active clotting factor requires a posttranslational modification of specific glutamate (E) residues. This modification is a carboxylation and the enzyme responsible for it requires vitamin K as a cofactor.
- The resultant modified E residues are gamma-carboxyglutamate (gla). This process is most clearly understood for factor H, also called preprothrombin. Prothrombin is modified pre-prothrombin. The gla residues are effective calcium ion chelators. Upon chelation of calcium, prothrombin interacts with phospholipids in membranes and is proteolysed to thrombin through the action of activated factor X (Xa).
- During the carboxylation reaction reduced hydroquinone form of vitamin K is converted to a 2,3-epoxide form. The regeneration of the hydroquinone form requires an uncharacterized reductase. This latter reaction is the site of action of the dicumarol-based anticoagulants such as warfarin.
- Dicumarol competitively inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase.

## Q-24 Discuss clinical significance of Vitamin K Deficiency. A-24

- Naturally occurring vitamin K is absorbed from the intestines only in the presence of bile salts and other lipids through interaction with chylomicrons. Therefore, fat malabsorptive diseases can result in vitamin K deficiency.
- The synthetic vitamin K3 is water soluble and absorbed irrespective of the presence of intestinal lipids and bile. Since the vitamin K2 form is synthesized by intestinal bacteria, deficiency of the vitamin in adults is rare.
- However, long-term antibiotic treatment can lead to deficiency in adults.
- The intestine of newborn infants is sterile, therefore, vitamin K deficiency in infants is possible if lacking from the early diet.
- The primary symptom of a deficiency in infants is a hemorrhagic syndrome.
- Obstructive jaundice and antibiotic therapy will result in vitamin K deficiency.
- Administration of dicumarol (to prevent intravascular thrombosis) will result in vitamin K deficiency.
- Deficiency in Vitamin K promotes delays in clotting. Excessive bleeding and bruises under the skin are symptoms.
- Q19. What are the dietary sources and daily requirement of Vitamin K?
- A19.
- Vitamin K is obtained from food sources such as alfalfa (also containing vitamin E which promotes absorption of vitamin K), kelp, all green leafy vegetables, tomatoes, cabbage, spinach, whole grain cereals and milk.
- Vitamin K is also produced within the body by the bacterial flora in the large intestine and it is thought that about 50% of the vitamin K in the blood of an adult is of bacterial origin.
- In the newborn however, the gut is sterile and it takes 5 to 7 days for it to become colonised by bacteria.

## Water --soluble vitamins

- Q-25 How chemical structures of water-soluble vitamins are related to their functions?
- A-25 In general, the water soluble vitamins consists of:

- Q-26 Describe briefly the structure of thiamine and its active form.

## A-26

- Thiamine is also known as vitamin Bl.
- Thiamin is derived from a substituted pyrimidine and a thiazole, which are coupled by a methylene bridge.
- Thiamin is rapidly converted to its active form, thiamin pyrophosphate, TPP, in the brain and liver by a specific enzyme; thiamin diphosphotransferase.
- TPP is necessary as a cofactor for the pyruvate and a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase catalyzed reactions as well as the transketolase catalyzed reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway.
- Q-27 What is dietary requirement of Thiamine (Vitamin Bl)?
- A-27 The dietary requirement for thiamine is proportional to the caloric intake of the diet and ranges from 1.0 1.5 mg/ day for normal adults. If the carbohydrate content of the diet is excessive then an increased thiamine intake will be required. Requirement is increased in pregnancy and lactation. It also depends of intestinal synthesis and absorption and fat content of diet (increased Pyruvate).
- Q-28 What are dietary sources of Vitamin Bl?
- A-28 Following are the dietary sources of Vitamin Bl:

High: 1000-10,OOOmicrogram/l00g, Wheat germ, rice bran, soybean flour yeast and ham.

Medium: 100-1000microgram/l00g, Peanuts, pecan, walnut, almonds, sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, potatoes, beans, eggs, milk and beef whole grain cereals and breads.

Low: lO-lOOmicrogram/lOOg, Apples, berries, banana, oranges, dates, beet, cabbage, carrot, radish, spinach etc.

## Q-29 Describe biochemical role of thiamine. A-29

- Active form of thiamine, that is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) is required for the key reactions catalyzed by Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (TCA cycle).
- Thiamine deficiency results in inhibition of carbohydrate metabolism causing accumulation of Pyruvate.

- TPP is also required for transketolase reaction of the pentose phosphate pathway.
- TPP functions in transmission of nerve impulses and is localized in peripheral nerve membranes.
- It is required for acetylcholine synthesis.
- It is required for ion translocation reactions in stimulated neural tissue.

## Q-30 Describe clinical manifestations of thiamine deficiency. A-30

- Vitamin Bl is necessary to breakdown &amp; release energy from carbohydrates. It is also necessary for the structure of the nerve membranes.
- A deficiency in thiamin intake leads to a severely reduced capacity of cells to generate energy as a result of its role in these reactions.
- The earliest symptoms of thiamin deficiency include constipation, loss of appetite, nausea as well as mental depression, peripheral neuropathy and fatigue.
- Chronic thiamin deficiency leads to more severe neurological symptoms including ataxia, mental confusion and loss of eye coordination.
- Other clinical symptoms of prolonged thiamin deficiency are related to cardiovascular and musculature defects.
- The severe deficiency of thiamine produces the disease called Beriberi, which affects the brain, heart, and nerves. This disease is prevalent in the Orient because of the abundance of rice they consume. The rice has been milled which strips the rice of thiamine.
- An alcohol-related thiamine deficiency, Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome, is caused by inadequate intake of thiamine as well as impaired absorption and storage, and is the common cause of dementia.
- Branched-chain ketoaciduria (commonly known as Maple Syrup Urine Disease; MSUD) is another ailment that may be caused by thiamine deficiency. In MSUD, the oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids derived from, i.e. valine, isoleucine, and leucine, is blocked due to an inadequate supply of the coenzyme thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). Clinical symptoms of MSUD include mental and physical retardation.
- Q-31 Describe briefly the structure of Riboflavin (Vitamin B-2) and its biochemical role.

## A-31

- Riboflavin is the precursor for the co enzymes, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD).

## Vitamins and Coenzymes

- The enzymes that require FMN or FAD as cofactors are termed flavoproteins. Several flavoproteins also contain metal ions and are termed metalloflavoproteins.
- Both classes of enzymes are involved in a wide range of redox reactions, e.g. succinate dehydrogenase and xanthme oxidase.
- During the course of the enzymatic reactions involving the flavoproteins the reduced forms of FMN and FAD are formed, FMNH2 and F ADI-h respectively.
- The flavin coenzymes are essential for energy production and cellular respiration.
- Q-32 What is dietary requirement of Riboflavin (Vitamin B-2) and what are dietary sources of it?

## Q-33 Describe clinical manifestations of riboflavin deficiency.

A-33 Symptoms associated with riboflavin deficiency include:

- Inflammation or open sores at the corners of the mouth or lips, a purple red inflamed tongue, angular stomatitis, glossitis, cheilosis, photophobia &amp; seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff).
- Riboflavin decomposes when exposed to visible light. This characteristic can lead to riboflavin deficiencies in newborns treated for hyperbilirubinemia by phototherapy.
- Riboflavin deficiency is often seen in chronic alcoholics due to their poor dietetic habits.

## Q-34 Describe briefly the structure of Niacin and its biochemical role. A-34

- Niacin (nicotinic acid and nicotinamide) is also known as vitamin B3 . Both nicotinic acid and nicotinamide can serve as the dietary source of vitamin B3.
- Niacin is required for the synthesis of the active forms of vitamin B3, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+).
- Both NAD+ and NADP+ function as cofactors for numerous dehydrogenases and oxidases class of enzymes.

Fundamentals ofBiochemistnj: A Textbook

- In anabolic role it maintains microsomal reductive biosynthesis and photolsynthesis.
- In catabolic role furnishes coenzymes for lipid catabolism, oxidative deamination and key reactions in TCA cycle.
- It acts as hydrogen and electron transfer agent and maintains respiratory chain in mitochondria.
- Niacin is not a true vitamin in the strictest definition since it can be derived from the amino acid tryptophan. However, the ability to utilize tryptophan for synthesis is inefficient (60 mg of tryptophan are required to synthesize 1 mg of niacin). Also, synthesiS of niacin from tryptophan requires vitamins B1 , B2 and B6, which would be limiting in them on a marginal diet.

## Q-35 What is dietary requirement of Niacin and what are dietary sources of it?

- A-35 The recommended daily requirement for niacin is 13 -19 niacin equivalents (NE) per day for a normal adult. One NE is equivalent to 1 mg of free niacin).

FollOWing are the dietary sources of Vitamin B-2:

High: 10-IOOmg/IOOg, Peanut, rice bran, liver, heart, Beef, chicken, tuna, yeast.

Medium: 1-IOmg/IOOg, Avocados, dates, figs, beans, sprouts, nuts.

Low: 0.1-1.0mg/100g, Apples, banana, berries, melon, peach, oranges, sprouts, tomato

## Q-36 Describe clinical manifestations of Niacin deficiency. A-36

- A diet deficient in niacin (as well as tryptophan) leads to glossitis of the tongue, dermatitis, weight loss, diarrhea, depression and dementia.
- Deficiency in niacin causes pellagra (rough skin). Pellagra involves the skin and digestive and nervous system. Symptoms are the 4 D's: Dermatitis, Diarrhea, Dementia, &amp; Death. Niacin also has vasodilating activity.
- Several physiological conditions (e.g. Hartnup disease and malignant carcinoid syndrome) can lead to niacin deficiency.
- In Hartnup disease tryptophan absorption is impaired and in malignant carcinoid syndrome tryptophan metabolism is altered resulting in excess serotonin synthesis.
- Certain drug therapies (e.g. isoniazid) can lead to niacin deficiency. Isoniazid (the hydraZide derivative of isonicotinic acid) is the primary drug for chemotherapy of tuberculosis.
- Nicotinic acid (but not nicotinamide) when administered in pharmacological doses of 2 - 4 g/ day lowers plasma cholesterol levels and has been shown to be a useful therapeutic for hypercholesterolemia. The

## Vitamins and Coenzymes

major action of nicotinic acid in this capacity is a reduction in fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue. Although nicotinic acid therapy lowers blood cholesterol it also causes a depletion of glycogen stores and fat reserves in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Additionally, there is an elevation in blood glucose and uric acid production. For these reasons nicotinic acid therapy is not recommended for' c4abetics or persons who suffer from gout.

## Q-37 A-37 Describe briefly the structure of Vitamin B-6 and its biochemical role.

- Pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine are collectively known as vitamin-B6. All three compounds are efficiently converted to the biologically active form of vitamin-B6, pyridoxal phosphate. The ATP requiring enzyme, pyridoxal kinase, catalyzes this conversion.
- Vitamin B6 is a component of a coenzyme.
- Pyridoxal phosphate is essential for energy production from amino acids and can be considered an energy-releasing vitamin.
- It is active in converting important amino acids to ketoacids.
- Pyridoxal phosphate functions as a in enzymes involved in transamination reactions required for the synthesis and catabolism of the amino acids.
- It acts as a cofactor for glycogen phosphorylase in glycogenolysis. Decreased glucose tolerance may be associated with vitamin B-6 deficiency.
- Pyridoxl phosphate is required for synthesis of neurotransmitters serotonin ami norepinephrine.
- It is necessary for the synthesis of sphingolipids necessary for myelin formation. This explains the irritability, nervousness and depression found with mild deficiency and peripheral neuropathy and convulsions observed with severe deficiency.
- Pyridoxal phosphate is required for the synthesis of delta aminolevulinic acid, a precursor of heme. Vitamin B-6 deficiency occasionally cause sideroblastic anemia, which is characteristically a microcytic anemia, observed in the presence of high serum iron.
- Vitamin B-6 is also required for the conversion o\.homocysteine to cysteine and hyperhomocysteinemia appears to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
- Pyridoxal phosphate is one of the cofactor required for conversion of 'tryptophan to NAD.

- A-39 Deficiency of Vitamin B6 can cause convulsions, lethargy, mental changes &amp; retardation, anemia, and skin inflammation. Deficiencies of vitamin B6 are rare and usually are related to an overall deficiency of all the Bcomplex vitamins. Isoniazid (see niacin deficiencies above) and penicillamine (used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and cystinurias) are two drugs that complex with pyridoxal and pyridoxal phosphate resulting in a deficiency in this vitamin. r

## Q-40 Write a short note on Pantohenic acid. A-40

- Pantothenic acid is also known as vitamin Bs.
- Pantothenic acid is formed from b-alanine and pantoic acid.
- Pantothenic acid is required for synthesis of coenzyme A, CoA and is a component of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain of fatty acid synthase.
- Pantothenic acid is, ,therefore, required for the metabolism of carbohydrate via the TCA cycle and all fats and proteins.
- At least 70 enzymes have been identified as requiring CoA or ACP derivatives for their function.
- Deficiency of pantothenic acid is extremely rare due to its widespread distribution in whole,'grain cereals, legumes and meat.
- Symptoms of pantnthenate deficiency are difficult to assess since they are subtle and resemble those of other B vitamin deficiencies.
- Present in all living tissues almost entirely in the . . f form of a coenzyme A (CoA). This co enzyme has many metabolic roles in the cell and lack of pantothenic acid can lead to depressed metabolism of both carbohydrates and fats.
- Q-41 Write a short note on Biotin.
- A-41 Biotin is the prosthetic group for number of caboxylation reactions e.g.

- Pyruvate carboxylase (for synthesis of oxaloacetate for gluconeogensis and replenishment of citric acid cycle.
- Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (fatty acid biosynthesis) and
- Propionyl-CoA carboxlase (methionine, leucine and valine metabolism) Biotin is found in numerous foods and also is synthesized by intestinal bacteria and as such deficiencies of.Jhe vitamin are rare. Deficiencies are generally seen only after long antibiotic therapies, which deplete the intestinal fauna or following excessive consumption of raw eggs. The latter is due to the affinity of the egg white protein, avidin, for biotin preventing intestinal absorption of the biotin.
- Q-42 Describe briefly the structure of Vitamin B-12 and its biochemical role.
- A-42
- Vitamin B12 is composed of a complex tetrapyrrol ring structure (corrin ring) and a cobalt ion in the center.1t is also known as cobalamin.
- Vitamin Bl2 is synthesized exclusively by microorganisms and is found in the liver of animals bound to protein a.s methycobalamin or 5'deoxyadenosylcobalamin.
- The vitamin must be hydrolyzed from protein in order to be active. Hydrolysis occurs in the stomach by gastric acids or the intestines by trypsin digestion following consumption of animal meat.
- The vitamin is then bound by intrinsic factor, a protein secreted by parietal cells of the stomach, and carried to the ileum where it is absorbed.
- Following absorption the vitamin is transported to the liver in the blood bound to transcobalamin 11.

There are only two clinically significant reactions in the body that require B12 as a cofactor.

1. During the catabolism of fatty acids with an odd number of carbon atoms and the amino acids valine, isoleucine and threonine th2 resultant propionyl-CoA is converted to succinyl-CoA for oxidation in the TCA cycle. One of the enzymes in this pathway, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor in the of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. The 5'-deoxyadenosine derivative of cobalamin is required for this reaction.
2. The second reaction requiring vitamin B12 clltalyzes the conversion of homocysteine to methionine and is catalyzed by methionine synthase. This reaction results in the transfer of the methyl group from N5methyltetrahydrofolate to hydroxycobalamin generating tetrahydrofolate and methylcobalamin during the process of the conversion.

## Q-43 Describe source, requirement and deficiency manifestations of Vitamin B-12.

- A-43 Vitamin B12 is not found in plant foods. The main source of B12 in human diet is through animal products like milk, eggs and liver. Vitamin B12 requires the presence of intrinsic factor from the stomach in order to be 
JP absorbed in the small intestines. JPe liver can store up to six years worth of vitamin B-12, hence deficiencies in this vitamin are rare.

B12 is needed for the efficient production of blood cells and for the health of the nervous system.

The inability to absorb Vitamin B12 occurs in pernicious anemia. In pernicious anemia intrinsic factor is missing. The anemia results from impaired DNA synthesis due to a block in purine and thymidine biosynthesis. The block in nucleotide biosynthesis is a consequence of the effect of vitamin B12 on folate metabolism. When vitamin B-12 is deficient essentially all of the folate becomes trapped as the N5methyltetrahydrofolate derivative as a result of the loss of functional methionine synthase. This trapping prevents the synthesis of other tetrahydrofolate derivatives. required for the purine and thymidine nucleotide biosynthesis p path~ays.

Neurological complications also are associated with vitamin B-12 deficiency and result from a progressive demyelination of nerve cells. The demyelination is thought to result from the increase in methylmalonylCoA that result from vitamin B-12 deficiency. Methylmalonyl-CoA is a competitive inhibitor of malonyl-CoA in fatty acid biosynthesis as well as being able to substitute for malonyl-CoA in any fatty acid biosynthesis that may occur. Since the myelin sheath is in continual flux the methylmalonylCoA-induced inhibition of fatty acid synthesis results in the eventual destruction of the sheath. The incorporation methylmalonyl-CoA into fatty acid biosynthesis results in branched-chain fatty acids being produced that may severely alter the architecture of the normal membrane structure of nerve cells

## Q-44 Write short not on Foric acid and its biochemical role.

- A-44 The active form of folic acid is folacin.
- Folic acid is a molecule consisting of a pteridine ring structure linked to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) that forms pteroic acid.
- Folic acid itself is then generated through the conjugation of glutamic acid residues to pteroic acid.
- When stored in the liver or ingested folic acid exists in a polyglutamate form. Intestinal mucosal cells remove some of the glutamate residues through the action of the lysosomal enzyme, conjugase. The removal of glutamate residues makes folate less negatively charged (from the

## Vitamins and Coenzymes

polyglutamic acids) and therefore more capable of passing through the basallamenal membrane of the epithelial cells of the intestine and into the bloodstream.

- Folic acid is reduced within cells (principally the liver where it is stored) to tetrahydrofolate (THF also H4folate) through the action of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an N enzyme.

The function of THF derivatives is to carry and transfer various forms of one-carbon units during biosynthetic reactions.

The one-carbon units are methyl, methylene, methenyl, formyl or formimino groups. These one-carbon transfer reactions are required in the biosynthesis of serine, methionine, glycine, choline and the purine nucIeotides and dTMP.

The ability to acquire choline and amino acids from the diet and to salvage the purine nucIeotides makes the role of N5, N10-methylene-THF in dTMP synthesis the most metabolically significant function for this vitamin.

The role of vitamin B12 and N5-methyl-THF in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine also can have a significant impact on the ability of cells to regenerate needed THF.

- Q-45 Describe source, requirement and deficiency manifestations of Folic acid.

## A-45

- Folic acid is obtained primarily from yeasts and leafy vegetables as well as animal liver. Animal cannot synthesize PABA nor attach glutamate residues to pteroic acid, thus, requiring folate intake in the diet.
- The body needs folic acid and folates (form of folic acid that occurs in food) to make DNA. Rapidly dividing cells in the blood, the lining of the colon and developing neutral tube need folic acid the most.
- Folic acid can prevent at least some children from being born with spina bifida or other birth defects.
- Folic acid might prevent heart disease in aqults by lowering levels of an artery damaging substance called homocysteine. Homocysteine is an amino acid that's used to make protein. It could damage arteries. Folic acid along with Vitamin B12 &amp;B6 all are needed to convert homocysteine to other things.
- Folic acid is also used in the treatment of spruea chronic form of malabsorption.
- Folate deficiency results in complications nearly identical to those described for vitamin B-12 deficiency.
- The most pronounced effect of folate deficiency on cellular processes is upon DNA synthesis. This is due to impairment in dTMP synthesis, which

## Fundamentals ofBiochemistnJ : A Textbook

leads to cell cycle arrest in S-phase of rapidly proliferating cells, in particular hematopoietic cells. The result is during erythrocyte maturation leads to abnormally large erythrocytes termed macrocytic anemia.

- Folate deficiencies are rare due to the adequate presence of folate in food. Poor dietary habits as those of chronic alcoholics can lead to folate deficiency.
- The predominant causes of folate' deficiency in non-alcoholics are impaired absorption or metabolism or an increased demand for the vitamin. The predominant condition requiring an increase in the daily intake of folate is pregnancy. This is due to an increased number of rapidly proliferating cells present in the blood.
- The need for folate will nearly double by the third trimester of pregnancy.
- Certain drugs such as anticonvulsants and oral contraceptives can impair the absorption of folate. Anticonvulsants also increase the rate of folate metabolism.

## Q-46 Write a short note on Vitamin C.

A-46 Vitamin C is also known as Ascorbic acid.

- Ascorbic acid is derived from glucose via the uronic acid pathway. The enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase responsible for the conversion of gulonolactone to ascorbic acid is absent in primates, thus making ascorbic acid an essential in the diet.
- The active form of vitamin C is ascorbate acid itself.
- The main function of ascorbate is as a reducing agent in a number of different reactions. Vitamin C has the potential to reduce cytochromes a and c of the respiratory chain as well as molecular oxygen.
- The most important reaction requiring ascorbate as a cofactor is the hydroxylation of proline residues in collagen. Vitamin C is, therefore, required for the maintenance of normal connective tissue as well as for wound healing since synthesis of connective tissue is the first event in wound tissue remodeling.
- Vitamin C also is neeessary for bone remodeling due to the presence of collagen in the organic matrix of bones.
- Several other metabolic reactions require vitamin C as a cofactor. These include the catabolislu of tyrosine and the synthesis of epinephrine from tyrosine and the synthesis of the bile acids.
- It is also believed that vitamin C is involved in the process of steroidogenesis since the adrenal cortex contains high levels of vitamin C, which are depleted upon adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation of the gland.

## Vitamins and Coenzymes

Vitamin C is found in fresh fruits and vegetables including citrus fruits. Vitamin C is necessary for the health of the supporting tissues of the body such as bone, cartilage and connective tissue.

Deficiency in vitamin C leads to the disease scurvy due to the role of the vitamin in the post-translational modification of collagens. Scurvy is characterized by easily bruised skin, muscle fatigue, soft swollen gums, decreased wound healing and hemorrhaging, osteoporosis, and anemia.

Vitamin C is readily absorbed and so the primary cause of vitamin C deficiency is poor diet and/or an increased requirement. The primary physiological state leading to an ihcreased requirement for vitamin C is severe stress (or trauma). This is due to a rapid depletion in the adrenal stores of the vitamin. The reason for the decrease in adrenal vitamin C levels is unclear but may be due either to redistribution of the vitamin to areas that need it or an overall increased utilization.

## Introduction to Metabolism

The reaction pathways that comprise metabolism are divided into two categories.

- Catabolism: degradation of molecules to provide energy.
- Anabolism: reactions using energy to synthesize new molecules for growth.

In catabolic reactions, complex substances are broken down to simpler compounds with a concomitant release of free energy. The released free energy during these catabolic reactions is conserved in the form of ATP or NADPH. The major nutrients such as carbohydrates, lipids and proteins are converted to common intermediate and further metabolised in a central oxidative pathway.

The opposite process occurs during biosynthesis. Simple organic molecules such as pyruvic acid, acetyl unit or intermediate compounds of citric acid cycle serve as starting molecules for varied biosynthetic products. The energy rich molecules such as ATP or NADPH derived from catabolic reactions are utilized in the biosynthetic reactions.

## Metabolic Pathways

"A metabolic pathway is a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, initiated by a flux-generating step and ending with either the loss of products to the environment, to a stored product (a metabolic 'sink') or in a reaction that precedes another flux-generating step (that is, the beginning of the next pathway)." Where a flux generating step is a non-equilibrium reaction that generates the flux going through the pathway and to whose rate all other reactions of the pathway conform. Note that by this definition some pathways may be inter-organ while others may take place in single compartment. We will explore this definition/ concept as we look at metabolism.

## Characteristics of Pathways

- Irreversible
- First committed step (flux generating step)
- Regulated
- Localized in eukaryotes

- Catabolic and anabolic pathways are generally distinguished by coenzymes and/ or compartmentalization.

The flux through a metabolic pathway is invariably controlled or regulated, most commonly by Feedback Inhibition, but also through Feed-forward activation. Regulation is one of the things that makes biochemistry "biological" and it will be a focus in our study.

The Stages of Catabolism: For convenience, catabolism can be divided into four hierarchical levels:

- Stage I: Hydrolysis of polymers to monomeric units (fat \_fatty acids and glycerol, protein \_ \_ amino acids, etc.)
- Stage 11: breakdown of products of Stage I to. pyruvate, acetyl CoA, and/ or intermediates of the Kreb's Cycle
- Stage Ill: Breakdown of Acetyl CoA by the Kreb's Cycle into carbon dioxide and water with the production of reducing equivalents (NADH etc.)
- Stage IV: Oxidation of the reducing equivalents by oxygen with the production of ATP via the Electron Transport System.

## Organic Reactions in Metabolism

Organic Reaction Mechanisms: It can be categorized all common biological reactions into four groups-

- Group-transfer reactions (transfer of an electrophile [acyl {RCOX}, phosphoryl {OP03X2-}, and glycosyl groups] between nucleophiles [akohols, amines, thiols, etc.])
- Redox Reactions
- Eliminations {eliminate H20, NH3, 3, ROH or RNH2}, Isomerizations, Rearrangements
- C-C bond formation or breakage (condensation and cleavage reactions).

## High Energy Compounds

Look at ATP. In the figure the bolded region is the "recognition" part of the molecule, while the polyphosphate is the chemically active portion. Each of the phosphoric acid anhydride bonds is unstable. That is hydrolyzing either will release a lot of energy.

(~)

~H

<!-- image -->

So why ATP? First, we want a compound with intermediate hydrolysis energy so it can pick up energy from some reactions and deliver to others. Second we want a kinetic ally stable molecule which is thermodynamically unstable. Thus acetic acid anhydride would not work: it is thermodynamically unstable to hydrolysis, but it is also kinetic ally unstable, with the carbonyl carbons wide open to water attack. Phosphoric acid anhydride is equally unstable, but is is sterically protected from water attack in order to react quickly we need a catalyst perfect.

ATP is sometimes referred to as a "High Energy" compound. High energy in this case does not refer to total energy in compound, rather just to energy of hydrolysis. Thus ATP is unstable to hydrolysis, or has a large negative LlG for hydrolysis. For biochemistry High Energy is defined in terms of ATP: if a compound's free energy for hydrolysis is equal to or greater than ATP's then it is "High Energy," if its free energy of hydrolysis is less than ATP's then it is not a "high energy" compound. Note that ATP has two high energy anhydride bonds.

## Thermodynamics in Metabolism

Thermodynamics is the study of energy and its transformations A knowledge of thermodynamics, which is the description of the relationships among the various forms of energy and how energy affects matter, enables one to determine whether a physical process is possible. The first and second law of thermodynamics are combined in the thermodynamics function, free energy (G). If the change in free energy (f1G) of reaction is negative, that reaction can occur spontaneously. If f1G is positive, an input of energy is required to derived the reaction. The unit of energy is jule (J) or the calorie (cal).

- Energy can be loosely defined as the ability of a system to do work on its surroundings. Work means moving things, deforming things, breaking things, etc.
- The free energy is defined as: AG = Gproducts- Greactants = AB -T As.

- When the free energy is negative we say the reaction is spontaneous, which simply means the reactants are favoured in the reaction equation as written.
- Note when a reaction is at equilibrium then the AG is zero.
- The first law of thermodynamics state that the total energy of a system and it's surroundings is a constant.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Where, EA is the energy of a system at the start of a process and EB at the end of the process. Q is the heat absorbed by the system and W is the work done by the system.

- The second law of the thermodynamics states that a process can occur spontaneously only if some of the entropies of the system and its surroundings increases (or that the universe tends towards maximum disorder), that is

- The process in which the system release heat (i.e., have a negative Q) are known as exothermic process.
- The process in which system gains heat (i.e., have a positive Q) are known as endothermic process.

Since free energy depends on conditions, chemists tabulate free energies under Standard Conditions, (AGO): 298 K, 1 atm., with all concentrations at 1 M.

For biological systems we define a slightly different standard free energy with [H+]= 10-7 M (pH=7), AGO '.

For non-standard conditions we can find the free energy of a reaction using: AG = AGo, + RT InQ. For the special case of equilibrium, the free energy is zero, so AGo, = -RT InK', AGo, = -5700 log K (in joules). Thus free energy is related to the equilibrium constant, K.

The free energy is zero, so AGo, = -RT InK', AGo, = -5700 In K (in joules @ 25°C). Thus free energy is related to the equilibrium constant, K. To provide a quantitative feeling for this relationship some values are tabulated below as Table 8.1:

Table S.l : Relationship between Free Energy and Equilibrium Constant (K)

| K    | logK   | (calories)                | (joules)            |
|------|--------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| 10-3 | -3     | 4,089                     | 17,100              |
| 10-1 | -1     | 1,363                     | 5,700               |

For non-equilibrium situations we can find the energy available for work using = AGO , + RT InQ, where Q is the mass action expression, Q = ([C][D])/([A][B]) for the reaction A + B \_ .. C + D.

One advantage of using free energy is that it is easier to evaluate the overall equilibrium/ energy for a series of sequential reactions (its additive instead of multiplicative): = Often use to predict feasibility of pathways, possible energy yields, and to determine when individual reactions are not at equilibrium (important for determining potential control steps etc.).

Note that the overall free energy determines spontaneity of the reaction the pathway doesn't matter! As noted above thermodynamics is pathway independent. Thus can drive unfavourable reactions by linking with favourable reactions. This can be done:

- llG-+ llG--1. Sequentially: A -) B G
- ) c, where the reaction of B to C pulls A to B; or
- A llG=+) B 2. In parallel: C &gt;c=-ID, where the two reactions are linked.

Example: glucose + phosphate to G-6-P +3300 cal) and ATP + water to ADP + Pi (AG= -7600 cal); mix together, no G-6-P (AG= -4300 cal). But link with enzyme, Glu + ATP \_ '"- G-6-P + ADP (dG= -4300 cal). All of metabolism depends on such coupled reactions. In essence catabolic reactions drive anabolic reactions etc., via direct, and more commonly, indirect, multi-step, coupling.

Metabolism would be extremely complex if coupled processes directly, however. Instead use an intermediate energy carrier: ATP. Thus, catabolic processes make ATP which can then be used for anabolic processes, locomotion, pumping ions across cell membranes (major contribution to basal metabolic rate or BMR), etc. Note that ATP is not used to store energy however. (Often compared to electricity's role in our culture).

## Overview of Meatbolism

Metabolism is the sum total' of all chemical reactions involved in maintaining the living state of the cells, and thus the organism. In general metabolism may be

"".~

divided into two categories: catabolism or the breakdown of molecules to obtain energy; and anabolism or the synthesis of all compounds needed by the cells (examples are DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis).

Bioenergetics is a term which describes the biochemical or metabolic pathways by which the cell ultimately obtains energy.

Nutrition is a science that deals with the relation of food substance to living things.

Essential foods supply energy (calories) and supply the necessary chemicals which the body itself cannot synthesize. Food provides a variety of substances that are essential for the building, upkeep, and repair of body tissues, and for the efficient functioning of the body.

A complete diet must supply the elements; carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and at least 18 other inorganic elements. The major elements are supplied in carbohydrates, lipids, and protein. In addition, at least 17 vitamins and water are necessary. If an essential nutrient is omitted from the diet, certain deficiency symptoms appear.

## Carbohydrates:

Foods supply carbohydrates in three forms: starch, sugar, and cellulose (fiber). Starch and sugar are major and essential sources of energy for humans. A lack of carbohydrates in the diet would probably result in an insufficient number of calories in the diet. Cellulose furnishes bulk in the diet.

Since the tissues of the body need glucose at all times, the diet must contain substances such as carbohydrates or substances which will yield glucose by digestion or metabolism. For the majority of the people in the world, more than half of the diet consists of carbohydrates from rice, wheat, bread, potatoes, macaroni.

## Proteins:

All life requires protein since it is the chief tissue builder and part of every cell in the body. Among other functions, proteins help to: make hemoglobin in the blood that carries oxygen to the cells; form anti-bodies that fight infection; supply nitrogen for DNA and RNA genetic material; and supply energy.

Proteins are necessary for nutrition because they contain amino acids. Among the 20 or more amino acids, the human body is unable to synthesize 8, therefore, these amino acids are called essential amino acids. A food containing protein may be of poor biological value if it is deficient in one or more of the 8 essential amino acids: lysine, tryptophan, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, valine, and threonine. Proteins of animal origin have the highest biological value because they contain a greater amount of the essential amino acids. Foods with the best quality protein are listed in diminishing quality order: whole eggs, milk, soybeans, meats, vegetables, and grains.

## Fats and Lipids:

Fats are concentrated sources of energy because they give twice as much energy as either carbohydrates or protein on a weight basis. The functions of fats are to: make up part of the structure of cells, form a protective cushion and heat insulation around vital organs, carry fat soluble vitamins, and provide a reserve storage for energy.

Three unsaturated fatty acids which are essential include: linoleic, linolinic, and arachidonic acids and have 2,3, and 4 double bonds respectively. Saturated fats, along with cholesterol, have been implicated in arteriosclerosis, "hardening of the arteries". For this reason, the diet should be decreased in saturated fats (animal) and increased in unsaturated fat (vegetable).

As already mentioned, metabolism refers to the chemical reactions carried out inside of the cell. The major metabolic reactions which we will study are those involving catabolism which is the breakdown of larger molecules to extract energy. The overall reaction for the combustion of glucose is written:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Although the above equation represents the overall metabolic reaction for carbohydrates, there are actually over thirty individual reactions. Each reaction is controlled by a different enzyme. The failure of an enzyme to function may have serious and possibly fatal consequences. Slightly less than half of the 686 kcal/ mole of the energy produced by combustion is available for storage and use by the cell with the remaining amount dissipated as heat.

Metabolism will be studied in various parts. Interrelationships will be pointed out as they are encountereD. Just as there are three basic biomolecules carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, the metabolism of each of these will be studied individually.

## Minerals:

The minerals in foods do not contribute directly to energy needs but are important as body regulators and as essential constituents in many vital substances within the body. A MINERAL is rather loosely defined as any element not normally a part of the structures of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. More than 50 elements are found in the human body.

About 25 elements have been found to be essential, since a deficiency produces specific deHciency symptoms. All of the minerals required by the human body are probably not known at this time. Although minerals may not be part of the structures of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, they are mixed in the foods in trace amounts during the growing process by uptake from the soil.

Major Minerals Include: calcium, phosphorus, iron, sodium, potassium, and chloride ions.

Other Essential Minerals Include: copper, cobalt, manganese, zinc, magnesium, fluorine, and iodine.

## Introduction to Metabolism

## Vitamins:

Vitamins are essential organic compounds that the human body cannot synthesize by itself and must therefore, be present in the diet. The term vitamin (vital amines) was coined by Casmir Funk from the Latin vita meaning "life" (essential for life) and amine because he thought that all of these compounds contained an amine functional group.

## Vitamins particularly important in metabolism include:

Vitamin A: The yellow and green pigments found in vegetables are called carotenes which are pro vitamins and are converted into Vitamin A.

Vitamin B2 is better known as riboflavin and is widely distributed in many foods. Riboflavin is used to form a coenzyme FAD important in the utilization of oxygen in the cells.

Niacin, also known as nicotinic acid, is also in the B complex of vitamins. Nicotinic acid was first obtained from the alkaloid nicotine in tobacco and was later found in many plant and animal tissues as niacin.

Nicotinamide is a part of the important coenzyme, Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD). This NAD+ co enzyme is important during biological oxidations and is discussed in detail in a later page.

Pantothenic Acid is art of the structure of coenzyme A.

## Flow of Energy in the Biosphere:

All of the chemical processes of the cell are called metaboli8m. The breakdown or degradation of complex organic molecules to yield simple molecules and energy is called catabolism. Anabolism is the total biosynthetic processes where large complex molecules are made from small simple molecules. Anabolic processes require energy because order is being created and thus work must be done. Overall, both processes of metabolism must occur concurrently because catabolism provides the energy necessary for anabolism.

Plants utilize energy from the sun in the photosynthetic process to synthesize larger molecules from smaller ones. On the other hand, animals and humans use the plants for fooD. The larger molecules are catabolized to provide energy.

The definition for an exothermic reaction is one where energy is given off. An endothermic reaction is where energy is required.

## Uses of Energy in the Cells

The body and cells need a constant supply of energy for a variety of reasons. Energy is needed to carry out mechanical work which involves the change in location or orientation of a body part or the cell itself. A major example is the energy required for the contraction of muscles.

Molecular transport also requires energy. The movement of molecules from an area of low concentration to an area of higher concentration requires energy since this is opposite to the normal movement of molecules. This process is also

called active transport. Examples include the movement of nutrie:rt raw materials into a cell and the movement of waste materials out of the cell.

Electrical work is also included under molecular transport since the establishment of a differential concentration of ions across a membrane is used to build up an electrical charge. The result of electrical work is the excitation and conduction of impulses in nerve and muscle cells.

Finally, energy is needed for the synthesis of new complex biochemical molecules. Biosynthesis involves the formation of many new molecules from simpler molecules. New cellular material is produced not only during active periods of growth but also in existing structures to repair and replace damaged molecules.

## Carbohydrate Metabolism

Cells mainly in the form of glucose utilize carbohydrate. The three principal monosaccharides resulting from the digestive processes are glucose, fructose and galactose. Both fructose and galactose are readily converted to glucose by the liver. Pentose sugars such as xylose, arabinose and ribose may be present in the diet, but their fate after absorption is obscure. Since glucose is the compound formed from starch and glycogen, the carbohydrate metabolism commences with this monosaccharide.

## The major metabolic processes in carbohydrates are: (Fig. 9.1)

- Glycolysis: splits glucose to pyruvate, which can be converted to lactate under anaerobi condition.
- Gluconeogenesis: converts pyruvate to glucose.
- Glycogenesis: synthesis of glycogen, carbohydrate fuel storage form.
- Glycogenolysis: breakdown of glycogen.
- Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) or HMP pathway: produces NADPH for cell biosynthesis.
- Kreb's TCA cycle or Citric Acid Cycle: converts Acetyl CoA to C02 and energy

Fig. 9.1 : Overviews of Glucose Metabolism

<!-- image -->

## Fundamentals of Biochemistry : A Textbook

Glycolysis is going to be our first pathway, and it is arguably the most important and universal of the metabolic pathways. But before we begin glycolysis let's take a brief look at how glucose (and carbohydrate generally) gets to the tissue from food intake.

## Digestion

- Initial, limited, breakdown of starch in mouth by salivary amylase.
- Low pH of stomach inactivates salivary amylase, denatures many proteins etc.
- In duodenum digestive enzymes are added from the pancreas (pancreatic amylase, lipases, proteases), pH is neutralized, and detergents (bile acids) are added from gall bladder.
- Starches, Proteins, Lipids are all hydrolyzed in duodenum and small intestine where monomers are absorbed across intestinal epithelium. Amino acids and sugars are released into the portal vein to travel to the liver and then to the rest of the body.
- First pass through the liver removes sugars and most of the amino acids for processing, storage with the release of glucose and fatty acids over time for use in the peripheral tissues.

## Glycolysis

Glycolysis, also called as Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (EMP pathway). Glycolysis is of central importance to the metabolism of eukaryotic cells. It links the metabolism of sugars to that of organic acids in the Krebs cycle, and in anaerobic organisms, provides the principle route of energy (ATP) generation. The reactions are rather complex, but can be seen as four basic processes (Fig. 9.2):

1. Isomerisation (catalysed by an isomerase): the intramolecular rearrangement of a molecule. This may be the transfer of a carboxyl group (C=O) from the end of a molecule (such as an aldose) to the middle (such as a ketose), or it may be the transfer of a phosphate group (the enzymes catalysing this latter sort of isomerisation are generally termed mutases).
2. Phosphorylation (catalysed by kinases): the movement of a phosphate group from one molecule (such as a phosphorylated sugar) to another (such as ATP).
3. Dehydration (catalysed by a dehydratase or hydrolase acting in reverse): the removal of water from a molecule.
4. Aldol cleavage (catalysed by an aldolase): the splitting of the carboncarbon bond in a -(C=O)-CH(OH)-CH(OH)- molecule to generate a free aldehyde.

Many of these reactions are freely reversible, so the glycolytic pathway can (for the most part) be run in either direction for the most part.

K' gives equilibrium values under standard conditions, while Q gives measured values for real tissues (Table 9.1). Attention should be paid for differences between these two values (small variations are expected since tissues are not at standard conditions). Here large differences indicate reactions which are not at equilibrium: these reactions must be controlled in some way by the organism! Thus, it can be seen that large differences for HK, PFK, and PK in brain, and HK and PFK in RBC's. Muscle is like brain. The AG values are plotted below as well for clarity. Finally the max activity column shows what kind of flux is possible through these enzymes -what does this indicate about these tissues and glycolysis?

- G-6-P inhibits this enzyme (product feedback inhibition), whereas P, activates.
- HK is an excellent example of induced fit,

## 2) G-6-P Isomerase: G-6-P to F-6-P.

<!-- image -->

The mechanism here is based on the Lobry-de-Bruyn von Ekenstein mechanism.

<!-- image -->

This would seem an ideal reaction to catalyze with a general acid/base mechanism. The enzyme has a bell shaped pH profile with pKa's at 7 &amp; 9 and has his and lys re si dues in the active site.

## 3) Phospho FructoKinase (PFK)-l: F-6-P to F-l,6-bis P.

The chemical mechanism here will be the same as for HK. However, requirement for Magnesium, as expected.

The next reaction involves an almost symmetrical cleavage of F-l,6-bisP to begin phase 11.

Irreversible Reactions: HK and PFK both catalyze biologically Irreversible reactions. That is the enzymes are designed such that the concentrations of the products are far below the KM values under physiological conditions, so the reverse reactions are not catalyzed!

The next reaction involves an almost symmetrical cleavage of F-l,6-bisP to begin phase 11:

## 4) Aldolase: F-l,6-bIS P to Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate &amp; Dihydroxyacetone Phosphate (DHAP)

<!-- image -->

This reaction is an aldol cleavage.

<!-- image -->

c-c bond making or breaking takes place, is only possible because of the acidity of C-2 (the C), which allows the formation of the nucleophilic carbanion. This acidity can be explained by the resonance structures which may be drawn for the alkyl-carbonyl "group":

<!-- image -->

Thus, in thinking about a catalytic mechanism for this reaction, it should be looked for ways to further stabilize the carbanion, making it an even better leaving group, and therefore, making the transition state easier to achieve.

The molecular mechanism for this enzyme, a type I aldolase, is shown below:

<!-- image -->

Fundamentals ofBiochemistnj : A Textbook

The enzyme works on the open form of the sugar, and uses a protonated schiff base intermediate at the heart of the mechanism.

The enzyme shows an Ordered Sequential Uni Bi kinetic mechanism:

<!-- image -->

## 5) Triose Phosphate Isomerase: DHAP to GA-3-P

<!-- image -->

DHAP is more stable, so most of the product ends up in the DHAP pool in the cell. Need a high activity enzyme to assure the availability of this pool for proceeding through Glycolysis.

TPI turns out to have a very high turnover number (number of molecules processed per active site per time): approx. 1,000,000 mol/min/site, apparently diffusion controlled. That is this enzyme appears to operate as fast as physically possible: as soon as substrate arrives it is converted. Sometimes referred to as a "perfect catalyst."

## 6) Glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase: GA-3-P to l,3-bis PGA

<!-- image -->

GA-3-P DH shows an Ordered Sequential Ter Bi kinetic mechanism:

<!-- image -->

Oxidizing an aldehyde to an 'acid,' creating a mixed acid anhydride in the process:. The thiolester can be phosphorylized to give l,3-bis PGA:

<!-- image -->

In this mechanism, the thiol group of cysteine is used both as catalyst and to preserve and transfer the free energy of the oxidation reaction. Thus, the carbon of the thiohemiacetal is less (+) than an acetal carbon and so it is easier to remove a hydride ion using NAD+, and the resulting thiol ester is a high energy compound which is readily attacked by phosphate.

(Note: Arsenate can substitute for phosphate forming highly unstable l-As-3PGA, which readily hydrolyses, thus producing no ATP one mechanism of As toxici ty . . ) ).

## 7) Phosphoglycerate Ki£lase: 1,3-bis PC:;;A to 3-PGA

<!-- image -->

After a series of unfavourable or marginal reactions now we get a highly favorable reaction again - pulling the pathway forward.

These two reactions couple an oxidation (favourable) to a phosphorylation (unfavourable) to give a substrate level oxidative phosphorylation with the capture of the oxidative energy as ATP.

Note that the energy investment in Stage 1 has now been "paid back" and Glycolysis is now energy neutral. This brings us to the next stage of Glycolysis and our ATP energy "profit."

## 8) Phosphoglycerate Mutase: 3-PGA to 2-PGA, begins the next stage of Glycolysis and our ATP energy "profit."

Note that there should be need for another enzyme to produce the BPG cofactor: Bisphosphoglycerate mutase- This enzyme catalyses the interconversion of 1,3bis PGA to 2,3-bis PGA, taking a high energy compound to a low energy compound: this enzyme is thus an obvious candidate for control, since if it had much activity it could drain Glycolysis of ATP production! Normally of very low activity. (But enhanced in RBC's, since they use BPG to control the binding of oxygen by haemoglobin. RBC's also have another enzyme, 2,3-bis PGA Pase to bring BPG back into Glycolysis as 2-PGA, but without making ATP.)

PK is a regulatory enzyme in some tissues. There are three isozymes:

- L-PK (Liver, Kidney, RBC's): greatest regulation. Sigmoidal 
- M-PK (Muscle, brain): least regulation -product inhibition by Pyruvate and MgATP.
- K-PK (Adipose, kidney, liver): intermediate regulation. Sigmoidal

while a general base aids the formation of the carbonyl carbon, and a positive charge draws electron charge up to the carboxyl group and aids the removal of the hydride ion.

Lactate DH also has isozymes. It is a tetramer of two types of monomers, H &amp; M. Can thus have 5 possible isomers: fu, H3M, H2M21 HM3, &amp; M4, with one active site per monomer.

## Regulation of Glycolysis

Regulation and Control: The concentration of citrate also affects PFK activity as a negative effector.

- PFK is the Main regulatory enzyme (flux generating step, first committed step) :
- o ATP is a strong negative effector of PFK.
- o Inhibition by "product" of pathway rather than enzyme, as expected for flux generating step.
- AMP is a strong positive effector for PFK, overcoming ATP effects, used as a "proxy" for ATP energy levels because if changes much greater, thus "amplifying" changes in [ATP].
- Hexokinase is regulated indirectly by PFK.
- o Regulated by product inhibition by G-6-P.
- G-6-P indicator of glucose use by the various pathways leading from it (Glycolysis, Glycogen synthesis/breakdown, Pentose Phosphate Pathway)
- o If PFK shuts down, then G-6-P builds up (if other uses also shut down), turning off HK.
- o If PFK active, then [G-6-P] decreases, allowing HK to resume activity.
- Pyruvate Kinase is also regulated indirectly by PFK. (Note there are other isozymes with differing regulation).
- o PK shows homotropic allosterism towards its substrate, PEP (sigmoidal kinetics).
- o PFK product, F-l,6-bisP, is a positive feed-forward activator of PK.
- If PFK is active F-l,6-bisP builds up (free energies of glycolysis between F-6P and PEP favor).

## Significance of Glycolysis

Glycolysis is an almost universal central pathway of glucose catabolism occurring in the cytoplasm of all the tissues of biological systems leading to generation of energy in the form of ATP for vital activities. It is the pathway through which the largest flux of carbon occurs in most cells. In plants, glycolysis is the key metabolic component of the respiratory process, which generates energy in the form of ATP in cells where photosynthesis is not taking place. Many types of anaerobic microorganisms are entirely dependent on glycolysis.

Mammalian tissues such as renal medulla and brain solely dependent on glycolysis for major sources of metabolic energy.

## Energy Yield

Two ATPs are used in glycolysis and four ATPs are synthesized for each molecules of glucose so that the net yield is two ATPs per glucose. Under aerobic conditions, the two NADH molecules arising from glycolysis also yield energy via oxidative phosphorylation.

Note that the 14 Angstrom arm of biocytin allows biotin to move between the two sites, in this case carrying the activated carboxyl group. In the second site a pyruvate carbanion then attacks the activated carboxyl group, regenerating the biotin cofactor and releasing oxaloacetate:

Pyruvate carboxylase is followed by the Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) reaction. In this reaction oxaloacetate is decarboxylated with a simultaneous phosphorylation by GTP to give GDP:

<!-- image -->

In eukaryotes the transformation of Pyruvate to Phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) is further complicated by the fact that oxaloacetate is generated from pyruvate and TCA Cycle intermediates only in the mitochondria, while PEP is converted to glucose in the cytosol. And oxaloacetate cannot cross the mitochondrial membrane efficiently (it is present at concentrations way below the KM of the

carrier, so it must be converted into malate or aspartate in order to cross the membrane.

The glycolytic reactions from PEP to F-l,6-bisP are fully reversible, but a second bypass is required to get around PFK. This is accomplished by FructosebisPhosphatase (F-bisPase):

And finally the third irreversible reaction, Glucokinase, is bypassed by Glucose6-Phosphatase (G-6-Pase):

Note that by hydrolyzing off the phosphates in these two reactions rather than recovering ATP they are made energetically favourable. Thus both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis can be favourable processes, even though they proceed in opposite directions: For Glycolysis, free energy= about -80 kJ, and for Gluconeogenesis, free energy= about -36 kJ due to differences in ATP. Or another way: if take glucose to pyruvate and then back to glucose again, 4 ATP's are lost.

In order to accomplish gluconeogenesis-reducing equivalents in the form of NADH must be provided to the GA-3-P DH enzyme and ATP must be provided to PGA Kinase. The obvious source for these is the Mitochondria, but then there are transport problems.

Pyruvate carboxylase: activated by acetyl CoA.

## Pyruvate Metabolism

Let's turn now to the fate of pyruvate in aerobic tissues. Pyruvate must first be transported into the mitochondria, where it can then be oxidized to give acetyl CoA, which can then be used to make fat for storage or it can be further oxidized to carbon dioxide via the Kreb's TCA Cycle.

The oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA is accomplished by the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase complex, a large, multi-component enzyme with three main enzyme subunits.

The first enzyme of this complex, pyruvate dehydrogenase (note that, unusual for the DH appellation, there is no direct NAD+ or FAD involvement), catalyzes two sequential reactions. In the first reaction, catalyzed by the subunit of the

enzyme, the coenzyme Thiamine Pyrophosphate (TPP), with a highly acidic carbon (a stable carbanion), attacks pyruvate at C-2 with the loss of carbon dioxide to give a covalent coenzyme-substrate intermediate. In the second reaction, catalyzed by the beta subunit, the ketol group is oxidatively transferred to one of the sulphurs' of the lipoyl coenzyme on the second enzyme of the complex, dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, to give an acetyl-lipoamide intermediate.

The lipoamide of dihydrolipoyl transacetylase constitutes a long arm which may now move the acetyl group from the active site of pyruvate DH to its own active site where the lipoamide is exchanged for Co enzyme A-SH. (On the mammalian enzyme the 60 subunits of the transacetylase seem to form a pool of lipoyl groups among which the acetyl groups are freely exchanged).

<!-- image -->

Note that in the reactions of dihydrolipoyl transacetylase the lipoamide has been reduced from a disulphide to two sulphhydryl groups. In order to continue operation lipoamide must be reoxidized and that is accomplished by the final enzyme of the complex, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase. The reactions catalyzed by this enzyme are complex, but the net result is the transfer of two electrons from the lipoamide to NAD+ to give NADH.

Overall then the Pyruvate DH Complex converts pyruvate into acetyl CoA in a physiologically irreversible reaction with the release of carbon dioxide and the capture of an electron pair as a hydride ion on NADH. Note the cofactors involved for this reaction sequence: TPP, FAD, Mg2+, lipoamide, Coenzyme A, andNAD+.

## Conversion of Pyruvate to Acetyl COA

## Enzyme is pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, composed of three enzymes:

- 1) Pyruvate dehydrogenase.
- 2) Dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase.
- 3) Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase.

## Reaction occurs in 5 steps:

- El uses TPP as a prosthetic group and decarboxylates pyruvate --&gt; forms HETPP intermediate.
- El then transfers acetyl group to oxidized lipoamide --&gt; acetyllipoamide.
- E2 transfers acetyl group to coenzyme A to form acetyl CoA; dihydrolipoamide becomes reduced.
- E3 reoxidizes lipoamide portion of E2; prosthetic group of E3 (FAD) oxidizes reduced lipoamide --&gt; F ADH2.
- NAD+ is reduced by E3-FADH --&gt; E3-FAD + NADH + H+.

## Kreb's TCA Cycle

The Tricarboxylic acid cycle is in many ways the central pathway of metabolism, both catabolically and anabolically: it is involved in the breakdown and synthesis of a variety of compounds. The oxidative breakdown of the acetyl group of acetyl CoA (Fig. 9.5).

## Carbohydrate Metabolism

•

Fig. 9.5 : Kreb's TCA Cycle.

<!-- image -->

First condense the acetyl group with a four carbon carrier to get a six carbon triacid. This is then rearranged and oxidized with loss of carbon dioxide to give a five carbon di-acid ketol very similar to pyruvate in structure. An irreversible DH Complex then creates a four carbon CoA derivative with the release of a second carbon dioxide. At this point it appears that acetyl has been released as carbon dioxide, however, the carrier has been reduced, and .modified. A series of reactions now regenerates the original carrier.

The first reaction of the cycle is an aldol condensation catalyzed by :

## Citrate Synthase:

<!-- image -->

Note that the enzyme catalyst enables the coupling of two chemically independent reactions: the aldol condensation (with free energy change of about zero) to the very favourable hydrolysis of the CoA thiol ester bond which drives the overall reaction far towards product. Essentially, we have used an ATP's worth of energy to drive the reaction to completion.

Unfortunately the resulting citrate is a tertiary alcohol which cannot be readily oxidized. Aconitase catalyzes the rearrangement of citrate to give an oxidizable secondary alcohol. This reaction involves an elimination/ addition sequence, catalyzed by an iron-sulphur cluster (Fe4S4), with an alkene intermediate, ClSAconitate:

<!-- image -->

It is then converted the 3° alcohol, citrate, into an oxidizable 2° alcohol, isocitrate. The next reaction is the first oxidation of the TCA Cycle.

The isocitrate alcohol can now be oxidized with NAD+ by Isocitrate DH to give an enzyme bound intermediate. The intermediate has a carboxyl group beta to a carbonyl carbon, so it has an excellent leaving group, C02, attached to a stabilized carbanion. Thus it immediately rearranges to lose carbon dioxide:

<!-- image -->

The resulting 2-oxo-glutarate (a-ketoglutarate) looks just like pyruvate with an R-group attached to the P-carbon, so it is broken down by a DH Complex, the uKetoglutarate DH Complex, just as pyruvate was. This gives succinyl-CoA and releases a second carbon dioxide. Note that at this point two carbons have been released, so formally, we have released the two carbons of Acetyl-CoA (Though neither of them came from the acetyl CoA we added)! We have also produced two NADH's (4 NADH/Glucose) which will result in the production of 5 ATP's (or: 4 x 2.5 ATP/NADH= 10 ATP's/Glucose). The remainder of the cycle is involved in the regeneration of oxaloacetate.

Succinyl-CoA, like acetyl-CoA, has a high-energy bond. However in this case the energy will be captured, using Succinyl-CoA Synthetase, to give a GTP which is energetically equivalent to an ATP (2 ATP's/Glucose). The mechanism of this reaction first involves the phosphorolysis by inorganic phosphate of the thiol ester bond to give a phosphoric-carboxylic mixed acid anhydride, followed by formation of a phosphorylated enzyme and finally transfer of the phosphate onto GDP.

The reactions beginning with succinate are representative of a common pattern, the "Mainline Sequence," seen repeatedly in biochemical pathways.

<!-- image -->

First, Succinate DH, an inner-mitochondrial membrane-bound enzyme and member of the mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS), oxidizes succinate to fumerate. This reaction uses the stronger oxidizer FAD as an oxidizing agent because of the added difficulty in oxidizing an alkane to an alkene. As a consequence of using this more powerful oxidizing agent, less ATP energy can be captured in oxidizing the resulting F ADH2 with oxygen (FAD is closer to oxygen in its oxidation potential). One and one-half ATP equivalents are obtained in this reaction (or: 2 x 1.5 ATP /FADH2= 3 ATP /Glucose).

The resulting alkene, Fumerate, is not readily oxidized. However, if water is added across the double bond an alcohol results which can be oxidized. Thus Fumerase catalyses a hydration reaction to give malate.

Finally, Malate DH catalyzes the dehydrogenation of malate to regenerate the original carrier, oxaloacetate, and finish the cycle. In addition another NADH is formed (and 2 x 2.5 ATP/NADH= 5 ATP/Glucose).

For the entire cycle, the production of 10 ATP/acetyl-CoA or 20 ATP/Glucose. The aerobic catabolism of glucose can then give a maximum total of 32 ATP / glucose by TCA cycle as summarized in below Table. 9.3

* In some tissues (insect flight muscle, fast twitch muscle) the reducing eqUIvalents of NADH must be pumped against a gradient at a cost of 1 ATP (it is used to make FADH2).

Note that because all catalysts (oxaloacetate, enzymes etc.) must be regenerated in looking at the overall operation of the cycle, only the acetyl group of acetylCoA tan be oxidized completely. Some intermediates, such as citrate, can be partially oxidized, but Kreb's cycle intermediate catabolism requires leaving the cycle at oxaloacetate and then returning as acetyl-CoA. It requires leaving the mitochondria for some reactions, and since the extremely low concentrations of oxaloacetate don't allow its efficient transport across the mitochondrial membrane (the Km of the carrier is much higher than [oxaloacetate]), malate is the species which actually leaves the mitochondria.

- Composed of 8 reactions.
- 4 carbon intermediates are regenerated.
- 2 molecules of CO2 released (6C--&gt; 4C).
- Most of energy stored as NADH and QH2•

## Regulation of the TCA Cycle

In order to understand the regulation of the TCA cycle, it is necessary to look at the LlG values for the various reactions and the kinetic properties of the enzymes. Values for the non-equilibrium reactions are tabulated below as Table 9.4:

Normally the concentrations of ATP, ADP, NAD+, and NADH are relatively constant in the mitosol and are thus unlikely to be very effective as allosteric regulators under most circumstances. On the other hand the availability of NAD+ and FAD as substrate will affect the rate not only of the reactions in the table, but also the near-equilibrium dehydrogenases. NAD+ availability in turn is determined by the activity of the electron transport system, whose activity is closely coupled to the availability of ADP. Thus high [ATP] will slow the TeA cycle since high [ATP] means low [ADP], which will slow the ETS resulting in low [NAD+]!

In muscle, Ca 2 + does show significant changes in concentration in the mitosol (recall that an increase in [Ca2+] concentration initiates muscle concentraction). Succinyl CoA will also show significant concentration changes under differing conditions and can thus also serve as an effective regulator, indicating carbon status in the second half of the cycle.

Interconversion of Metabolic Intermediates: The TCA cycle has a central place in metabolism (even in anaerobic organisms) via its use to interconvert metabolites.

## Glycogen Metabolism

## Glycogenesis:

<!-- image -->

Start with G-6-P, again note that this molecule is at a metabolic crossroads. First convert to G-I-P using Phosphoglucomutase:

<!-- image -->

Fundamentals ofBiochemistnj : A Textbook

This reaction is very much like PGA Mutase, requiring the bis phosphorylated intermediate to form and to regenerate the phosphorylated enzyme intermediate. Note that this reaction is easily reversible, though it favors G-6-P.

Again a separate "support" enzyme, Phosphoglucokinase, is required to form the intermediate, this time using ATP as the energy source:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, which catalyzes the next reaction, has a near zero aGo ':

<!-- image -->

G-1-P

It is driven to completion by the hydrolysis of the PP, to 2 P, by Pyrophosphatase with a aGo, of about -32 kJ (approx. one ATP's worth of energy).

Finally glycogen is synthesized with Glycogen Synthase:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This reaction is favoured by a AGo, of about 12 kJ, thus the overall synthesis of glycogen from G-1-P is favoured by a standard free energy of about 40 kJ. Note that the glucose is added to the non-reducing end of a glycogen strand, and that there is a net investment of 2 ATP equivalents per glucose (ATP to ADP and UTP to UDP, regenerated with ATP to ADP). Note also that glycogen synthase requires a 'primer.' That is it needs to have a glycogen chain to add on to. What happens then in new cells to make new glycogen granules? Can use a special primer protein (glycogenin). Thus glycogen granules have a protein core.

These reactions will give linear glycogen strands, additional reactions are required to produce branching. Branching enzyme [amylo--(1,4) to -(1,6)transglycosylase] transfers a block of re si dues from the end of one chain to another chain making a 1,6-linkage (cannot be closer than 4 residues to a previous branch). [FYI: For efficient release of glucose re si dues it has been

determined that the optimum branching pattern is a new branch every 13 residues, with two branchs per strand].

## Regulation of Glycogen Synthase:

Active --dephosphorylated Inactive -phosphorylated

Glycogen Synthase-i: independent (i) of glucose-6-phosphate for its activity.

Glycogen Synthase-d: dependence (d) on glucose-6-phosphate, mechanism for storing glucose when overabundance is signalled by a build-up of glucose-6phosphate (Fig. 9.6).

Glycogen is broken down using Phosphorylase to phosphorylize off glucose residues:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Note that no ATP is required to recover Glucose phosphate from glycogen. This is a major advantage in anaerobic tissues, get one more ATP / glucose (3 instead of 2!).

Phosphorylase can only cleave l,4-linkages, so now need Debranching enzyme. Debranching enzyme has two activities: a) amylo--l,4-transferase moves the terminal three residues of a chain onto another branch; whereas -l,6-glucosidase hydrolyzes the l,6-linkage to give free glucose. Thus, muscle can release a small quantity of glucose into the blood without actually doing gluconeogenesis.

Regulation: complex, to ensure glucose remains stored as glycogen until absolutely required to maintain blood glucose homeostasis or to supply energy to the cell.

<!-- image -->

- Whether or not it is phosphorylated it can exist in a "tense"(inactive) form or a "relaxed" (active) form (only high glucose can force the existence of the phosphorylated tense form).
- The enzyme can be rapidly activated without undergoing phosphorylation in response to a hormonal signal.

Activator: AMP

Inhibitor: ATP, glucose, glucose-6-phosphate

## Glycogen Control

Since the Glycogen synthase and phosphorylase reactions are in opposition we need a control system. Glycogen storage/release strategies vary widely with different tissues. In liver, glycogen is used to provide glucose to the serum between meals -it serves a homeostatic function. Glycogen control in liver is thus designed to breakdown and release glycogen when serum [glucose] is low and synthesize glycogen when serum [glucose] is high.

## Glycogen Control in Liver

In the liver glycogen metabolism is largely regulated by glucose concentrations, which in turn reflect serum glucose concentrations.

1. In liver glycogen phosphorylase a binds tightly to protein phosphatase1 and inhibits it. At high concentrations, glucose binds to phosphorylase, causing a release of the protein phosphatase. Protein phosphatase then inactivates m-phosphorylase a by hydrolyzing off Pi to give inactive 0phosphorylase b.
2. o Glycogen breakdown and glucose release are inhibited.

2. Protein phosphatase can now also hydrolyze PI from inactive Glycogen synthase b to give the active Glycogen synthase a.
2. o Glycogen synthesis is activated.
3. As glucose concentrations drop, glycogen phosphorylase rebinds protein phosphatase and protein kinases rephosphorylate the enzymes, resulting in glucose release.

The net result is that glycogen is synthesized when [glucose] is high, and it is broken down when [glucose] is low.

## Glycogen Control Cascade

In muscle it turns out that glycogen synthesis/breakdown is controlled by a very complex system enabling both rapid response to emergencies and exquisite overall control of the opposing activities to respond to a variety of situations. This is accomplished through the Glycogen Cascade Control system.

Response begins with a hormonal signal, such as adrenalin, binding to the receptor on the cell surface. This results in the phosphorylation of GDP to GTP on an intracellular G-protein. The G-protein can now interact with Adenylate cyclase to produce the "second messenger" 3', 5'- cyclic AMP (cAMP). Cyclic AMP then binds to the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, releasing the active catalytic subunits (C), which can now phosphorylate inactive o-phosphorylase kinase b to the active m-phosphorylase kinase a (0= original, m= modified, b= inactive, a= active). Phosphorylase kinase a then phosphorylates o-Glycogen phosphorylase b to the active m-Glycogen phosphorylase a, resulting in the breakdown of glycogen with the release of G-lP.

Note the parallel kinase cascade which simultaneously shuts down Glycogen synthase.

Finally, one does not always have a warning, that is to get the endocrine system going to produce adrenalin, thus the release of Calcium in the muscle cells bypasses much of the cascade, activating normally inactive 0Phosphorylase kinase b , which then acts on both the phosphorylase and the synthase.

## Pentose Phosphate Pathway (HMP Pathway)

- Provides NADPH (serves as e- donor) and forms ribose 5-phosphate (nucleotide synthesis).

- Pathway active is tissues that synthesize fatty acids or sterols because large amounts of NADPH needed.
- In muscle and brain, little PPP activity.
- All reactions are cytosolic.
- Divided into 2 stages:

The Pentose Phosphate Pathway is an alternate pathway for glucose oxidation which is used to provide reducing equivalents in support of biosynthesis. Thus although it involves the catabolism of glucose, it is generally going to be active only when anabolism is taking place (Fig. 9.9).

This pathway is usually treated in two parts: the oxidative portion, and the sugar interconversions portion. In the oxidative part, glucose is first oxidized to a lactone, and then oxidatively decarboxylated. Note that in each case NADP+ is the oxidant as opposed to NAD+. Note also that the two DH reactions are both physiologically irreversible, due in part to the very low concentrations of NADPH in cells.

The first enzyme, G-6-P DH, is highly specific for glucose (it is frequently used as the basis of specific glucose assays). In this reaction the #1 (aldehydic) carbon of glucose is oxidized to a lactone (cyclized carboxylic acid). This is the first committed step for this pathway and it is regulated by the availability of NADP+ (substrate availability). Since NADP+ and NADPH are in very low concentrations and the NADP+ /NADPH ratio is very low, and since NADP+ is generated only during biosynthetic reactions this results in a close coupling of the oxidative portion of this pathway to reductive biosynthesis.

Next Gluconolactonase opens the ring with the addition of a molecule of water. Then 6-P-gluconate DH oxidizes the #3 carbon to a ketone. This results in the #2 carbon becoming somewhat acidic, thus destabilizing the carboxyl group, which is then lost to give the five carbon ribulose-5-P.

In the non-oxidative portion of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway a series of sugar interconversions takes the RU-5-P to intermediates of other pathways: Ribose-5-P for nucleotide biosynthesis, and F-6-P and Ga-3-P for glycolysis/ gluconeogenesis. All of these reactions are near equilibrium, with fluxes driven by supply and use of the three intermediates listed above.

Fig. 9.9 : Schematic Presentation of Pentose Phosphate Pathway

<!-- image -->

In the first two reactions of this phase Ribulose-5-phosphate is converted either to Ribose-5-P via a l,2-enediol intermediate, or to Xylulose-5-P via a 2,3-enediol intermedia te.

These two 5-C sugars, R-5-P and Xu-5-P, are now interconverted to a 7-C sugar, Sedoheptulose-7-P, and a 3-C sugar, Glyceraldehyde-3-P. This reaction is catalyzed by Transketolase, a Thiamine pyrophosphate dependent enzyme which catalyzes the transfer of C2 units. In the first part of this reaction the TPP carbanion makes a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group of xylulose. In the resulting intermediate the C2-C3 bond is destabilized and cleavage takes place to yield the enzyme bound 2-(l,2-dihydroxyethyl)-TPP resonance stabilized carbanion:

<!-- image -->

This first part of the reaction is very similar to the first part of the Pyruvate DH catalyzed reaction in the Pyruvate DH Complex. (Ga-3-P is the leaving group instead of carbon dioxide; there is a 1,2-dihydroxyethyl instead of a 1hydroxyethyl carbanion intermediate.) In the second part of the reaction the carbanion then attacks the aldehyde of R-5-P to give Su-7-P and regenerate the TPP catalyst:

~

<!-- image -->

This is similar to the second part of the Pyruvate DH reaction where the hydroxyethyl group attacks the disufide of the lipoamide.

Transaldolase catalyzes the transfer of a C3 unit. The reaction occurs via an aldol cleavage similar to that seen with aldolase: there is a schiff base intermediate formed with an active site lysine. The difference between aldolase and transaldolase is in the acceptor groups: in aldolase the acceptor is a proton, in transaldolase it is another sugar. This reaction yields a F-6-P, which can go to Glycolysis, and an E-4-P which reacts with Xu-5-P catalyzed by the same transketolase seen above. This second transketolase reaction yields F-6-P and Ga3-P, both intermediates of Glycolysis and the end products of the Pentose-P pathway.

The interconversions of the sugars in this pathway are summarized in the flow diagram below:

<!-- image -->

The principle products of this pathway are R-5-P and NADPH. Under reductive biosynthetic conditions where R-5-P is not needed the Pentose-P pathway can be used to completely oxidize G-6-P to 6 carbon dioxide molecules with the concomitant production of 12 NADPH's. Note also that when R-5-P is needed and NADPH is not needed for reductive biosynthesis it can be made from F-6-P and Ga-3-P.

## The core reactions of the pathway can be summarized as -

Glu-6-Phosphate + 2NADP+ +H20 ---'Ribose-5-Phosphate + 2NADPH +H+ + C02

## Regulation of Pentose Phosphate Pathway

- Controlled by levels of NADP+.
- Controlled step is dehydrogenation of glucose 6-phosphate to 6phosphogluconolactone.
- Enzyme stimulated by high [NADP+].
- Nonoxidative branch controlled primarily by substrate availability.

## Mitochondrial Electron Transport System

The electron transport system involves a variety of redox reactions, so it is useful to review some electrochemical relationships. First, the free energy of a reaction is related to the reduction potential for electron transfer by the equation:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where n= moles of electrons transferred, and F is Faraday's constant (96,485 J Vlmol-1). The standard reduction potential for a reaction can be found from the difference between the reduction potentials of the electron acceptors and donors:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The Nernst equation, which describes the reduction potential for an electrochemical reaction,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

is very similar to the free energy equation,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

while the equation for the reduction potential for an equilibrium system,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

reminds one of the free energy/equilibrium relationship,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Note the standard reduction potentials and resultant standard free energies: NADH: -0.315 V; 02: +0.815 V. So for the reaction:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Thus, 0.815 -(- 0.315) = 1.130 V, which, using the relationship between free energy and potential gives -218 kJ / mol. The free energy of hydrolysis of ATP is 30.5 kJ/mol, so if three ATP are made/pair of electrons flowing through ETS 91.5 kJ are captured out of 218 kJ available, or 42% . T This is of course under "Standard Conditions." However, under physiological conditions this may actually be closer to 70 %.

## The Electron Transport System

The inner mitochondrial membrane is protein rich. If carefully broken down, it is very rich in five protein complexes: I -IV are large protein complexes involved in electron transport, while V is the ATP sythatase driven by proton gradients.

Electron flow through the ETS is summarized below. Only major electron carriers are shown within complexes.'

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## Diagramatically:

<!-- image -->

Notice the central position of Coenzyme Q (aka ubiquinone, COQlO). The pool of CoQ forms a reservoir where reducing equivalents may be stored between the various inputs to the ETS, such as Complex I or Complex 11 and Complex Ill.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Fatty acyl-CoA \_ \_\_ F Fatty acyl-CoA DHsoluble \_\_ [F [FAD \_Fe-5] \_ \_\_ Q Q

With these electron transport components, path can be created for the transfer of electrons from substrate to oxygen. Complexes I and IV obviously have enough energy change to support the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP, while complex III is marginal and complex II obviously does not have sufficient energy change.

But how is this energy captured? Mitochondria appear to be using the energy of moving the electrons through this potential gradient to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The resulting proton motive gradient can then be used to make ATP. Lets look at the four complexes and what seems to be occurring in each.

Complex I: The electrons are received as a pair (a hydride ion) on NADH, but most carriers can only handle single electrons so FMN acts as a transducer, picking up a pair of electrons, but passing them on singly to the FeS centers in this complex. The electrons are then passed singly on to CoQ, which, like FMN can carry either pairs or single electrons. Four H+ are pumped across the inner mitochondrial'membrane by complex I. (Note that formally the protons from NADH and H+ can be considered as going to FMNH2 and the UQH2.).

Complex 11: An electron pair enters this complex via FAD going to F ADH2. Of course FAD has the same"active portion as FMN so it can again carry electrons single or in pairs. F ADH2 then passes its electrons on singly to FeS centers, which then pass them on to CoQ. No protons are pumped by this complex. Thus difference in the number of ATPs produced by NADH vs. FADH2 can be distinguished.

Co enzyme Q (ubiquinone): CoQ is a quinone with a long hydrocarbon tail. It exists as a pool of CoQ molecules dissolved in and diffusing through the lipid bilayer of the inner membrane. Both the quinone (oxidized) and quinol (reduced) form of the cofactor can "flip" in the membrane, thus the quinone ring can freely cross. CoQ can pick up electrons one at a time from either Complex I or Il, then diffuse through the bilayer until collision with complex III allows it to pass them singly to that complex.

Complex Ill: This complex picks up single electrons from the CoQ pool, taking the quinol form in two steps to the quinone form of the coenzyme. One electron is passed on through FeS centers to Cytochrome c, while a second is recycled via cytochrome b (bS66 &amp; bs60) to reduce Q to Q- in the Q-cycle. A second QH2 repeats the cycle and provides the second electron for the first recycled Q. The net result is the oxidation of one QH2 and the transport of four H+ for each pair of electrons flowing through the complex.

Cytochrome C: This cytochrome is a mobile protein carrier attached to the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (a peripheral membrane protein). It transports single electrons from complex III to complex IV.

Complex IV: This complex picks up electrons singly from cytochrome c and transfers them via' cytochrome a-CuA to cytochrome a3-CuB where they are passed on to oxygen. Note that four electrons are needed for each oxygen molecule, and that the equivalent of two H+ are transferred out of the matrix for each pair of electrons (4 protons/ oxygen). The high for this complex, which would allow a significantly larger number of protons to be pumped, assures the completion of the overall reaction of oxygen and NADH to give water.

(For an insider's review and evidence on ETS and OxPhos see M. Saraste Science 283 (5 March 1999) pp. 1488-93).

## Oxidative Phosphorylation

Oxidative phosphorylation is the process in which ATP molecules are formed as a result of the transfer of electrons from the reducing equivalents, NADH or FADH2 (produced by glycolysis, the citric acid cycle and fatty acid oxidation) to oxygen by a series of electron carriers in the form of a chain located in the inner membrane of mitochondria. This is the final reaction sequence of respiration. Since the electrons are transferred by a series of electron carriers in the form of a chain, it is known as electron transport system (ETS).

The electrons are transferred along a set of cytochromes in the form of a chain in steps from the more electronegative components (NADH/F ADH2) to the more electropositive oxygen.

## ATP Synthase

ATP synthase uses the proton gradient to make ATP from ADP and PI. It is bound to the inner membrane and has a characteristic knob and stalk structure. It can be broken into two multi protein components: The FI component' (the "knob") hydrolyses ATP when it is isolated by itself and is referred to as F1 ATPase. The Fo component is a membrane spanning proton channel. When the two components are linked the passage of protons through the channel is coupled to ATP synthesis. According to the binding-change mechanism there are three sites in the 3beta3 oligomer of the knob. At any given time the three sites are in three different conformations -open, loose, or tight. Each site passes sequentially through the three conformations, apparently while physically rotating 120 0 for each change. Following one site:

- 1) ADP and PI bind to the site in the open conformation.

- 2) Passage of 3 protons through the channel causes the -beta oligomer to rotate 120 0 and change to the loose or L conformation, holding the ADP and Pi (all three active sites to go to the next conformation simultaneously).
- 3) Passage of another 3 protons through the channel causes the -beta oligomer to rotate 120 0 and change to the tight conformation witR consequent condensation of ADP and Pi to ATP.
- 4) Passage of another 3 protons through the channel causes the -beta oligomer to rotate 120 0 and change to the open conformation, releasing ATP. Note the net result of 3 protons/ ATP.

(For review and evidence on ETS and OxPhos see M. Saraste Science 283 (5 March 1999) pp 1488-93; for ATPase 'motor' see Paul D. Boyer (18 Nov 1999) "What matkes ATP synthase spin?" Nature 402: 247-8.)

## Mitochondrial Transport/Communication

Given the requirement for a very tight inner-mitochondrial membrane in order to maintain the proton electrochemical gradient, how do important charged molecules such as ATP and NADH get across the membrane?

ADP and ATP are obviously among the most important substances to transport into and out of the mitochondria. Adenine nucleotide translocase exchanges matrix ATP for cytosolic ADP in their magnesium-free forms. Note that in this exchange ATp4- leaves the matrix as ADp3- goes in, resulting in a net loss of (1-) for the matrix. This increases the charge gradient across the membrane, and thus must be driven by the mitochondrial proton gradient. Of course P, must also be transported across the membrane with ADP to make ATP in the matrix. This is accomplished using another transporter which co-transports a dihydrogen phosphate and a single proton in an electroneutral process. Note the addition of these two processes is equivalent to moving one proton from the cytosol to the matrix, costing the gradient one proton (moving a negative charge out is equivalent to moving a positive charge out).

The net cost of providing an ATP to the cytosol is thus four protons: three to convert ADP + Pi to ATP and one to transport ATP out of, while bringing ADP and Pi into, the matrix. This accounts for the theoretical yield of ATP: (10 H+ /NADH)/(4 H+ / ATP) = 2.5 ATP /NADH.

(This means that bacteria may get more ATP (up to 38 ATP's instead of the 32 expected in mammals).

Reducing Equivalent Shuttles: In aerobic metabolism NADH from glycolysis

must be regenerated to NAD+ in the mitochondria. Two shuttles are important in different tissues/ organisms for this process:

- Glycerol Phosphate Shuttle: This shuttle is found in insect flight muscles, which sustain very high rates of aerobic glycolysis, and fast twitch muscle in humans. The NAD+ is actually regenerated in the cytosol by the Glycerol-3-P DH reaction, which reduces dihydroxyacetone-P to glycerol3-P:

<!-- image -->

CH,OPO

The glycerol-3-P is then reoxidized to dihydroxyacetone-P by Flavoprotein dehydrogenase. This enzyme is situated on the inner mitochondrial membranes outer surface. It uses FAD to oxidize the glycerol-3-P to dihydroxyacetone-P, passing the electrons to CoQ (note the similarity to succinate DH, except for the location on the outer instead of the inner surface of the membrane). The organism can thus get 1.5 ATP equivalents for this NADH.

- Malate-aspartate Shuttle: This is the common shuttle in mammalian systems. It is both more complex and more efficient than the glycerol phosphate shuttle, yielding 2.5 ATP /NADH. It can be thought of as occurring in two phases:
- o Transport of electrons from the cytosol to the mitosol, and
- o Regeneration of the cytosolic oxaloacetate.

In phase 1 oxaloacetate in the cytosol oxidizes NADH to NAD+ using malate DH. Malate is then transported across the inner membrane in exchange for an a-ketoglutarate by Dicarboxylate translocase. Malate is then oxidized back to oxaloacetate in the matrix by Kreb's Cycle malate DH to give NADH in the matrix. In phase 2 the oxaloacetate is transaminated to aspartate, taking a-ketoglutarate to glutamate, which are transported, and the process is balanced as in the figure.

## Regulation of Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation

The ETS appears to be regulated largely by the availability of ADP and NADH. For most catabolic situations [ADP] will be the controlling factor. Note that the effects of [ADP] will integrate the regulation of TCA and Glycolysis with that of ETS.

- Liver: oxidizes fats, produces ketones, exports triglycerides.
- Muscle: uses fats and ketones as an energy source.
- Adipose Tissue: stores fats as triacylglycerol and releases fatty acids as needed for energy.
- Mature RBC's (no mitochondria) / Brain (lack of enzymes): do not use fats for energy.

## Lipolysis

Fats Come From Two Main Sources: stored body fat and dietary fat. Dietary fat must first be emulsified to increase its surface area for contact with the water soluble lipases. This occurs largely in the duodenum after mixing with the bile acids, a family of cholesterol derived detergents. Triacylglycerols can then be hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase to free fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerol:

<!-- image -->

CH,-OH

The fatty acids and monoacylglycerol are absorbed by the intestinal cells, converted to fatty acyl CoA and reassembled into triacylglycerols. The triacyl glycerols then assemble with phospholipids and lipoproteins to form chylomicrons for transport through the lymph and blood to the tissues.

When the chylomicrons reach tissue cells the triacylglycerols are again hydrolyzed by lipoprotein lipase to fatty acids which can be taken up by the peripheral tissue cells. In adipose cells the fatty acids are then converted into fatty acyl CoA's and combined into triacylglycerols for storage. Alternatively the fatty acids can be broken down for energy using the various oxidative pathway in specific tissues.

## Oxidation of Fatty Acids

Fatty acids obtained by hydrolysis of fats undergo different oxidative pathways designated as (a), beta (13) and omega (m) pathways.

## a.-oxidation

a-Oxidation of fatty acids has been found in certain tissues especially in brain tissue of mammals and plant systems. It does not require CoA intermediates and no high-energy phosphates are generated. This type of oxidation results in the removal of one carbon at a time from the carboxyl end of the fatty acid. The physiological role of a-oxidation in plants is not yet fully established but it has been suggested that it may be involved in the degradation of long chain fatty acids as observed in many animal tissues. a-Oxidation is clearly the main source of the odd-carbon fatty acids and their derivatives that occur in some plant lipids. In this process, sequential removal of one carbon at a time from free fatty acids of chain length ranging from C13 to C18 occur.

## m-Oxidation

Fundamentals ofBiochemistnj : A Textbook

m-Oxidation is normally a very minor pathway brought about by hydroxylase enzymes involving cytochrome P-450 in the endoplasmic reticulum. Fatty acids with oxygen function (alcoholic or carboxyl) at the methyl terminal end (m-end) are formed by m-oxidation and frequently occur as constituents of cutin and suberin. The requirements for the oxygenase-mediated conversion of a m-methyl fatty acyl CoA into a m-hydroxymethyl fatty acyl CoA are molecular oxygen, reduced pyridine nucleotide and a non-heme iron protein in higher plants.

## of Fatty Acids

In 1904, Franz Kn.oop made a critical contribution to the elucidation of the mechanism of fatty acid oxidation and demonstrated that most of the fatty acids are degraded by oxidation at the of fatty acids takes place in mitochondria. Fatty adds are activated before they enter into mitochondria for oxidation.

Free fatty acids are introduced into the cytosol, but f3-oxidation occurs in the mitosol. Two situations occur.

- Short to medium length fatty acids are permeable to the mitochondrial membrane. They are activated to fatty acyl CoA derivatives in the mitochondrial matrix by Butyryl-CoA Synthetase:

<!-- image -->

Note that two ATP equivalents are required: the phosphoanhydride and thioester bonds are of similar free energies, so a second phosphoanhydride bond is also hydrolyzed to drive the reaction to completion.

- Long chain fatty acids are are bound to Fatty acid binding protein for transport within the cytosol. They are impermeable to the inner mitochondrial membrane. They are thus esterified in the cytosol by microsomal Fatty acyl CoA synthetase in a reaction identical to the one shown above. Again the reaction is driven by the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate. The enzyme involves an acyl AMP intermediate:

with Ping Pang Bi Uni-Uni Bi kinetics:

Carnitine Carrier: The resulting acyl CoA ester is still not permeable to the mitochondrial membrane so a carrier system is needed. In this system the fatty acyl group is transferred from CoA-S to carnitine, diffuses across the membrane, and then transferred back to another CoA-S within the matrix:

<!-- image -->

~

The carnitine h'ansport step across the inner membrane is the slow step and flux generating step for P-oxidation of long chain fatty acids. Note that this system maintains separate pools of CoASH in the cytosol vs. the matrix.

Once inside the mitochodrial matrix fatty acyl CoA can be broken down in the matrix by the fatty acid f3-oxidation cycle.

Reactions 2 through 5 recycle to remove consecutive 2-carbon units. On the final cycle, 2 acetyl CoA molecules are formed. Thus, a 16 carbon fatty acid needs to cycle only 7 times.

- The first reaction in of acyl CoA is the formation of trans ,12enoyl CoA or a, acyl CoA in presence of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and the coenzyme, FAD.
- The next step is the hydration of the double bond between C-2 and C-3 by enoyl CoA hydratase with the formation of ~ acyl CoA.
- In the third step, the acyl CoA is dehydrogenated in the presence of acyl CoA dehydrogenase and NAD+ forming -ketoacyl CoA.
- In the last step of CoA reacts with coenzyme A in the presence of the enzyme, thiolase. The products of this reaction are acetyl CoA and an acyl CoA containing two carbons less than the original acyl CoA molecule that underwent oxidation.

By the above steps of fatty acids are completely degraded to acetyl CoA units. The acetyl CoA formed from fatty acids can be oxidised to carbon dioxide and water via citric acid cycle.

## Energetics of f3 oxidation

The energetics or the energy conserved in terms of ATP by oxidation of a molecule of palmitic acid is given below:

Palmitic acid (16 carbons) undergoes forming eight molecules of acetyl CoA by undergoing seven spirals. When one cycle of -oxidation takes place, one molecule of F ADH2, one molecule of NADH and one molecule of acetyl CoA are produced. Electrons from these reducing equivalents (F ADH2 and NADH) are transported through the respiratory chain in mitochondria with simultaneous regeneration of high-energy phosphate bonds. Mitochondrial oxidation of F ADH2 eventually results in the net formation of about 1.5 ATP. Likewise, oxidation of electrons from NADH yields 2.5 molecules of ATP. Hence, a total of four ATP molecules are formed per cycle and ten molecules of ATP are formed through Krebs's cycle from each molecule of acetyl CoA.

If we look at ATP/C we get 106/16= 6.63, while for glucose we get 32/6= 5.33, and for hexanoate: 36/6= 6. Thus, as expected, the fatty acids, being more reduced on average, give more energy per carbon and per gram. Along with the fact that they are stored without water of hydration, unlike carbohydrates, we can see their advantage as energy storage molecules for mobile organisms.

Another measure of fuel use is the P /0 ratio, the number of ATP's generated for each oxygen atom consumed. For palmitate PlO = 106/46 = 2.3. As a comparison the P /0 for glucose = 32/12 = 2.67. Note that, By this measure glucose is the better fuel in situation where oxygen is limiting because glucose will give more ATP's per ml of oxygen.

## 13 Oxidation of Odd Chain Fatty Acids

Most biological fatty acids are of even-numbered carbon chains. However, some organisms, particularly in the arctic marine environment, have a relatively high odd-chain component. Thus in organisms such as traditional Eskimo (Innuit) and polar bears eating lots of seal blubber and fish, odd-chain fatty acids can constitute a significant dietary component. These fatty acids are handled normally through p-oxidation until the last turn, where pentyl-CoA is cleaved into acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA. The propionyl-CoA is converted through a number of steps to succinyl-CoA. These steps involve addition of carbon dioxide (with ATP energy) and an isomerization requiring cobalamin derived from vitamin Bn The succinyl-CoA can then be metabolized normally via the TCA cycle to malate, then to PEP and then to either 2-PGA for gluconeogenesis or to Pyruvate for energy production. (Propionate metabolism is also important to ruminants, since it is produced as a fermentation product by their symbiotic bacteria from plant matter.)

End products are propionyl CoA and acetyl CoA caused by cleavage of a 5carbon fatty acid during the final cycle.

## 13-0xidation of unsaturated fatty acids

One might think that since an unsaturated fatty acid is created during betaoxidation that unsaturated fatty acids should be handled easily by this system. However two problems occur due to the high level of specificity of the enzymes involved:

- First the double bond can occur in the wrong position, and
- Second, unsaturated fatty acids are commonly cis-, whereas betaoxidation uses trans-fatty acids.

Two new enzymes are required to handle these situations: Enoyl-CoA isomerase (isomerizes a cis-3,4-double bond to a trans-2,3-double bond), and 2,4-DienoylCoA reductase (reduces the cis-4,5-double bond in the trans-2,3-cis-4,5-dienoylCoA derivative formed during beta-oxidation). The resulting products are then broken down by the beta-oxidation enzymes.

## Ketone Bodies Metabolism

Fatty acids can be used as the major fuel for tissues sllch as muscle, but they cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, and thus cannot be used by the central nervous system (CNS). This becomes a major problem during starvation (fasting), particularly for organisms such as ourselves in which CNS metabolism constitute a major portion of the resting basal metabolic rate. These organism must provide glucose to the CNS to provide for metabolic needs, and thus during the initial fasting period must break down substantial amounts of muscle tissue (protein) to provide the amino acid precursors of gluconeogenesis. Obviously the organism could not survive long under such a regime. What is needed is an alternate fuel source based on fat rather than muscle. The so-called ketone bodies serve this function:

<!-- image -->

Fundame1ltals ofBiochemistnJ : A Textbook

Note that only two of the ketone bodies are in fact ketones, and that acetone is an "unintentional" breakdown product resulting from the instability of acetoacetate at body temperature. Acetone is not available as fuel to any significant extent, and is thus a waste product.

CNS tissues can use ketone bodies any time, the problem is the normally very low concentrations « 0.3 mM) compared to glucose ,(about 4 mM). Since the KM'S for both are similar, the CNS doesn't begin to use ketone bodies in preference to glucose until their concentration exceed's the concentration of glucose in the serum.

The system becomes saturated at about 7 mM. The limiting factor in using ketone bodies then becomes the ability of the liver to synthesis them, which requires the induction of the enzymes required for acetoacetate biosynthesis. Normal glucose concentrations inhibit ketone body synthesis, thus the ketone bodies will only begin to be synthesized in high concentrations as serum glucose concentrations fall. As an example, ketone bodies might start at about 0.1 mM after an overnight fast, rise to 3 mM after a 3 day fast, and go to 7-8 mM with prolonged fasting (&gt;24 days).

## Ketone Body Formation in Liver

Fig. 10.4 : Ketone Body Formation

<!-- image -->

Ketogenesis occurs in the matrix of liver mitochondria. Fatty acids are first broken down to acetyl CoA via beta-oxidation (providing energy for liver metabolism from the reducing equivalents generated). The acetyl CoA is then used in ketogenesis:

<!-- image -->

- The first reaction (1), catalyzed by thiolase, involves a Claisen condensation of two acetyl CoA's (essentially a reversal of the last reaction of beta-oxidation) to give acetoacetyl CoA almost the final prodUct! The problem now is to remove the CoASH.

FUlldamelltals ofBiochemistnj : A Textbook

- This is done in a two stage process involving first the addition of a third acetyl CoA by the second enzyme: HMG-CoA synthase (2) via an aldol condensation (note the similarity to the formation of citrate in the TCA cycle, including driving the reaction by the hydrolysis of a thiol ester bond).
- The resulting beta-Hydroxy-beta-glutaryl-CoA is now cleaved by HMGCoA lyase (3), regenerating acetyl CoA and giving the product: acetoacetate.

Depending on the status of the liver, acetoacetate can now be reduced to give Dbeta-hydroxybutyrate, which delivers more reducing equivalents, and thus ATP equivalents, to the peripheral tissues at the expense of the liver:

## Normal Prevention of Ketoacidosis (Fig. 10.5)

Insulin whose release is promoted by ketone bodies, inhibits lipolysis to decrease the supply of fatty acids and thus curtail ketogenesis ---&gt; prevent ketoacidosis.

+ NAD+ ---&gt; NADH + acetoacetate acetoacetate + succinyl CoA ---&gt; acetoacetyl CoA + succinate acetoacetyl CoA + CoA ---&gt; 2 acetyl CoA

## Ketone Bodies as Fuel

The ketone bodies are water soluble and are transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane as well as across the blood-brain barrier and cell membranes. Thus, they can be used as a fuel source by a variety of tissues including the CNS. They are preferred substrates for aerobic muscle and heart, thus sparing glucose when they are available.

In the peripheral tissues the ketones must be reconverted to acetyl CoA in the mitochondria (Fig. 10.6):

Fig. 10.6 : Acetyl CoA synthesis from Ketone.

<!-- image -->

- If we start with beta-hydroxybutyrate, then it is first oxidized to acetoacetate with the production of one NADH (1).
- Co enzyme A must now be added to the acetoacetate. The thioester bond is a high energy bond, so ATP equivalents must be used. In this case the energy comes from a transesterification of the CoAS from succinyl CoA to acetoacetate by Coenzyme A transferase (2). The succinyl CoA comes from the TCA cycle where a GTP is not made.

- The acetoacetyl CoA is now cleaved to two acetyl CoA's with Thiolase (3).

The energy provided to the peripheral tissues from acetoacetate and for betahydroxybutyrate are shown below: (Table 10.1)

Table 10.1 : Energetics of Ketone Metabolism

| Reaction            | Energy Product      | Factor              | Multiplier          |   ATPEquiv. |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| CoA transferase     | succinate (-GTP)    | 1                   | 1                   |        -1   |
| Kreb's NAD+ DH's    | NADH                | 2.5x3               | 2                   |        15   |
| Kreb's              | GTP                 | 1                   | 2                   |         2   |
| Kreb's FADH DH      | FADH2               | 1.5                 | 2                   |         3   |
| Acetoacetate Total: | Acetoacetate Total: | Acetoacetate Total: | Acetoacetate Total: |        19   |
| Butyrate DH         | NADH                | 2.5                 | 1                   |         2.5 |
| Butyrate Total:     | Butyrate Total:     | Butyrate Total:     | Butyrate Total:     |        21.5 |

Note the P /0 ratios for the ketone bodies: Acetoacetate = 19 ATP / 80= 2.38; Butyrate = 21.5 ATP / 9 0 = 2.39 which are higher than we calculated for palmitate (2.3), but again lower than for glucose (2.67).

These reactions can be thought of as giving the liver overall control of fat metabolism. Lower vertebrates store fat in the liver. In a sense adipose tissue can be thought of then as "extended liver" tissue metabolically. Note that the liver can adjust the amount of reducing equivalents, and thus ATP equivalents, it sends to the peripheral tissues by adjusting the amounts of acetoacetate vs. betahydroxybutyrate it exports. Thus, the percentage of the free energy distributed between the tissues is shown below as Table 10.2:

Table 10.2: Free Energy Distribution between Tissues during FAT Metabolism

| Compound \ Tissue   | Liver   | Peripheral Tissues   |
|---------------------|---------|----------------------|
| 3-hydroxybutyrate   | 17%     | 83%                  |
| Acetoacetate        | 26%     | 74%                  |

## Fatty Acid Biosynthesis

Earlier, it was thought that fatty acid biosynthesis occurred by reversal of the p-oxidation pathway. On the contrary, it occurs by a separate pathway that differs from p-oxidation in several ways.

- Synthesis takes place in the cytosol, in contrast with degradation or oxidation, which occurs in the mitochondrial matrix.
- Intermediates in fatty acid synthesis are covalently linked to the sulphhydryl group of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) whereas intermediates in fatty acid breakdown are bonded to coenzyme A.
- The enzymes of fatty acid synthesis in animals are joined in a single polypeptide chain called fatty acid synthase. In contrast, !he degradative enzymes do not seem to be associated. Plants employ separate enzymes to carry out the biosynthetic reactions.
- The reductant in fatty acid synthesis is NADPH, whereas the oxidants in fatty acid oxidation are NAD+ and FAD.

## Lipogenesis (Fatty Acid Synthesis)

## Pyruvate-Malate Cycle

The reactions of fatty acid synthesis all take place in the cytosol, but acetyl-CoA is made in the mitochondria and can't cross the inner membrane. The PyruvateMalate Cycle (Citrate-Pyruvate Cycle) is used to take acetyl- groups to the cytosol while simultaneously providing a source of NADPH from NADH, and thus, coupling fatty acid synthesis to Glycolysis (Fig. 10.7). Note that the acetylCoA is first joined to oxaloacetate to make citrate which is readily transported out of the mitochondria using a co-transporter. The citrate is then cleaved to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate, a process requiring ATP to make it favourable (recall the condensation was spontaneous). Acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis is now available in the cytosol, but oxaloacetate must be regenerated for the mitosol.

The cytosolic oxaloacetate is now dehydrogenated to give malate and NAD+. Malate is next oxidized by Malic enzyme to give pyruvate in a reaction which also provides NADPH for use in biosynthesis. (Note that NADH generated in Glycolysis is "converted" to NADPH for Fatty Acid synthesis in these two reactions, while simultaneously regenerating the NAD+ needed to continue Glycolysis!) The pyruvate can now cross into the mitosol to be used in regenerating oxaloacetate.

Now, let fatty acid biosynthesis starting from glucose. For that look at the integration of the various pathways involved: Glycolysis, hexose monophosphate shunt, Pyruvate-malate shuttle, and Fatty acid biosynthesis. It requires reducing equivalents, redox balance and provision of required cytosolic ATP's as well as carbon source.

## The following steps are involved in fatty acid biosynthesis in cytosol

Two reactions enable the synthesis pathway:

- Acetyl-CoA is "activated" by the addition of a carbon dioxide, and
- NADPH is substituted as a more powerful reducing agent than F ADH2 .

Thus, the first step in fatty acid biosynthesis is to activate acetyl-CoA by the addition of a carbon dioxide using Acetyl-CoA carboxylase. This reaction is chemically identical to the Pyruvate carboxylase reaction.

<!-- image -->

This reaction is physiologically ilTeversible and is the flux generating or first committed step of fatty acid biosynthesis. As expected it is regulated. In mammals acetyl-CoA carboxylase is a large enzyme existing as inactive protomers (560,000 MW, 4 subunits, one biotin), which can assemble into active filaments (4 -10 million MW).

## Formation of the filaments (activation) is:

- Promoted by dtrate. but
- Inhibited by fatty acyl CoA.

As these are excellent indicators of the fuel status of the cell.

In addition to the activator/inhibitor controls of citrate and fatty acyl-CoA, the enzyme is also under hormonal control (note the similarities to glycogen control):

- Glucagon stimulates phosphorylation and thus inactivation of the liver enzyme, while
- Adrenalin (epinephrin) stimulates phosphorylation and inactivation in adipose tissue.

In mammals Fatty Acid Synthase (F AS) catalyzes fatty acid synthesis on a homodimeric enzyme, each monomer of which has seven catalytic activities, and eight sites! (In bacteria such as E. coli there are seven separate enzymes plus an acyl-carrier protein. Plants also have individual proteins for the various activities which are associated in a quaternary complex. In eukaryotes other than plants the FAS are complexes of multifunctional proteins. The enzyme weighs approximately 500,000 Daltons.

There are two carriers on this complex.

- The first is referred to as ACP1 which acts as a holding station for acetylor fatty acyl- groups. In either case they are bound to a cysteinyl sulphhydryl group.
- The second, ACP2, binds the growing fatty acyl chain during the condensation and reduction reactions of the cycle. In this case the acyl group is carried on a long phosphopantetheine prosthetic group. This

arm allows the growing chain to move among the various active sites without being lost to the solution.

Fig. 10.8 : Fatty Acid Synthesis Reactions

<!-- image -->

Looking at the the Fatty Acid Synthase reactions (Fig. 10.8)

The first reaction, catalyzed by Acetyl-CoA:ACP transacylase, transfers an acetyl group from Coenzyme A to the cysteinyl-S on ACPl.

- Next, a malonyl-group is transferred from a Coenzyme A to the pantetheinyl-S of ACP2 by Malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase.

- Now the carbon dioxide leaves the malonyl group, with the electrons from its bond attacking the acyl group on ACP1. This reaction is catalyzed by Ketoacyl-ACP synthase.

Now have a beta-ketoacyl group ready to go through the reverse of the reactions of beta-oxidation.

- Thus, the keto-group is reduced to an alcohol using NADPH (betaketoacyl-ACP reductase),
- followed by the elimination of the alcohol (Enoyl-ACP hydrase) to give the cis-2,3-enoyl group.
- The enoyl is then reduced with NADPH substituting for FADH2 (EnoylACP reductase) to give the saturated acyl group.
- Finally the acyl group is transferred from the pantotheinyl-S of ACP2 to the cysteinyl-S on ACPl (ACP-acyltransferase) leaving ACP2 available to pick up the next malonyl moiety.
- After seven turns of the cycle palmitate is released.
- Elongation by the fatty acid synthase complex stops upon formation of palmitate (16 C). Further elongation and the formation of double bonds are carried out by other enzyme systems.

## Fatty Acid Modification

## Elongation of Fatty Acids

If the Fatty Acid Synthetase Complex only makes palmitate where do the rest of the fatty acids come from? Of course palmitate can be shortened by fl-oxidation. For longer fatty acids there is a fatty acid elongation system localized on the ER. The same reactions occur as in the Synthetase, but now have individual enzymes. Palmitate is first activated to palmitoyl-CoA. The enzymes prefer C-16 or less as

## Lipid Metabolism

substrate; thus the major product is stearoyl-CoA. However longer unsaturated fatty acids will also bind (the linking of the cis double bond makes them effectively shorter), so unsaturated fatty acids of 20,22, and 24-C's are also made. Thus most longer fatty acids are polyunsaturated.

A second system for fatty acid elongation exists in the mitosol, probably for provision of long fatty acids for mitochondrial structure. This system uses most of the same activities of P.oxidation, but an NADPH dependent Enoyl-CoA reductase replaces the FAD dependent dehydrogenase.

## Acyl-CoA Synthetase

<!-- image -->

Elongation: microsomal process (ER), requires malonylCoA and two NADPH, process is similar to that occurring with fatty acid synthase.

## Fatty Acid Desaturation

Plants and animals differ in where double bonds are introduced into fatty acids.

Plants put in Ay (a 9-10 double bond) and then can put in double bonds at three carbon intervals towards the tail (AP, A1S). They can also add A6, but not common.

Animals also start with A9, then can add at three carbon intervals toward carboxy end (A6 and A6). Animals cannot add towards the tail. Therefore animals cannot make linoleoyl-CoA (A9, 12; C18) but can make oleoyl-CoA (A9; C18). Animals must therefore take in plant products (either directly as herbivores, or indirectly by eating herbivores) to acquire essential unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic and arachadonic acids.

Both plants and animals use mixed function oxidases (simultaneously oxidize two substrates): Acyl-CoA desaturases localized on the ER. Similar mixed function oxidases are also used to modify structural components of cells, hormones etc. so we will use the acyl-CoA desaturase as an example for this group of enzymes. In the acyl-CoA desaturase reaction molecular oxygen is used to oxidize both a fatty acid and NADH, each providing two of the the four electrons needed by the oxygen:

The mammalian acyl desaturases are components in mini-electron transport systems on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, for example the acyl-CoA desaturase complex:

Unsaturation: microsomal process, reduction with NADPH or NADH, molecular oxygen is required.

## Regulation of Fatty Acid Metabolism

Fatty acid metabolism is regulated both hormonally and via feed-back inhibition and feed-forward activation. Thus mobilization of free fatty acids from the adipose tissue results from low insulin levels. The free fatty acids are then transported through the blood to the rest of the body including the liver. In the liver fatty acid oxidation and ketone body synthesis is achvated by glucagon. Note that glucagon and insulin levels are opposite: high insulin =low' glucagon and vice-versa. So for low insulin will also have high glucagon, thus fatty acids will be released from the adipose and will be converted in the liver into ketone bodies.

The regulation of fatty acid oxidation, fatty acid synthesis and ketone body synthesis in the liver is summarized in fig. 10.10:

| Fuel      |   Total ATP |   O 2  Used |   ATPj"C" |   CO-j02 |   ATP!,O" Atom |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Palmitate |         387 |          69 |      8.12 |      0.7 |           2.8  |

Note: ATP / "0" Atom is a measure of "fuel" efficiency

Fats: Produce more ATP per "C", however it is at the expense of more oxygen (ATP / 0 atom), thus the respiratory quotient (C02 / 02) is the lowest. (Table 10.3)

Glucose: is the better fuel under conditions of O2 limitation, giving more ATP / 0 atom. (Table 10.3)

Ketones: in starvation increase the amount of 02 needed to burn fuel to C02 (C02 / 02) only a small amount as compared to fats. The energy yield per carbon for ketones is similar to glucose. The brains energy needs and 02 availability can be met nearly as well by ketones, as by glucose. (Table 10.3).

- [1] 5-Phosphoribosyl-l-pyrophosphate (PRPP) synthesis is catalyzed by PRPP synthetase. Note: the ribose-5-phosphate for the pathway comes from the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (see "PPP /Gluconeogenesis" Lecture).
- [2] The committed, regulated step in the pathway catalyzed by PRPP amidotransferase. Note: glutamine provides the nitrogen to initiate purine synthesis.
3. Inosinic acid (IMP) is the first purine formed, overall 6 high energy phosphate bonds are consumed to produce IMP.
- [3] IMP + Aspartate + GTP ---&gt; Adenylosuccinate; Enzyme: Adenylosuccinate Synthetase.
- [4] Adenylosuccinate ---&gt; AMP + Fumarate; Enzyme: Adenylosuccinase.
- [5] IMP + NAD+ ---&gt; XMP + NADH + H+; Enzyme: IMP Dehydrogenase.
- [6] XMP + Glutamine + ATP ---&gt; GMP + Glutamate + AMP + PP,.

## Regulation of Purine Biosynthesis

The PRPP amidotransferase enzyme exists as an active mono mer and an inactive polymer (see "Introduction to Metabolism" Lecture). IMP, GMP and AMP all inactivate the enzyme causing a shift towards the polymerized inactive form. PRPP causes a shift towards the active monomeric form.

AMP is a competitive inhibitor (see "Enzymes:Catalysis and Kinetics" Lecture) of Adenylosuccinate Synthetase, GMP competitively inhibits IMP Dehydrogenase. Note: GTP is required for AMP synthesis and ATP is required for GMP synthesis, hence there is coordinated regulation of these nucleotides.

- [10] Guanase deaminates guanine to xanthine.
- [11] Xanthine Oxidase oxidizes hypoxanthine to xanthine, then xanthine to uric acid which is excreted in the urine. Co-factors: Mo, Fe3+, FAD, 02.

Note: H202, a product of this reaction must be scavenged by Glutathione Reduced (see "PPP /Gluconeogenesis" Lecture).

- [12] Purines can be salvaged after steps [7] and [8] by reconverting the nucleosides to nucleotides via nucleotide kinases. The free base can also be saved in a salvage pathway consisting of a single enzyme, HGPRT: Hypoxanthine + PRPP ---&gt; IMP + PP,; Guanine + PRPP ---&gt; GMP + PP, . The importance of this pathway as a source of nucleotides is shown by the consequences of a deficiency of HGPRT known as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This pathway reduces the need and energy expenditure of biosynthesis by maintaining nucleotide levels.

## Clinical Correlates

Gout: is associated with either increased formation of uric acid or its decreased renal excretion. Its incidence is relatively high, occurring in about 0.3% of the population. Gout produces a painful arthritis, particularly in the joints of the extremities. There are two broad types of gout: primary and secondary. Primary gout, of which there are several types, is inherited. Secondary gout is brought on by a variety of disorders such as leukaemia.

Individuals with a glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-P ---&gt; Glucose, in the liver) deficiency develop a glycogen storage disease. This condition results in hypo glycemia, low blood sugar, accumulation of lactic acid and ketones. Distal kidney tubule excretion of uric acid is inhibited and hyperuricemia (XS uric acid) and gout results.

Treatment: the drug that most effectively inhibits the formation of uric acid is allopurinol, a competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. Hypoxanthine and xanthine are excreted during allopurinol therapy. Allopurinol, as with guanine and hypoxanthine, can be converted to its ribonucleotide form by HGPRT. Reducing the formation of uric acid with allopurinol relieves the symptoms of gout and decreases the possibility that uric acid kidney stones will form.

Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome: produces a tremendous overproduction of uric acid. The defect in Lesch-Nyhan disease is the gene for the enzyme HGPRT. The lack of HGPRT activity is virtually complete and the disease is X-linked recessive and thus limited to males. It has a very early age of on-set and is characterized by extremely aggressive behaviour that generally leads to self-mutilation. Initially

HGPRT was considered a minor player in the "salvage" pathway that permitted reutilization of purine bases. The severity of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome suggests a more important role. Most likely the enzyme has an essential role in non-hepatic tissues where biosynthesis of purines occurs at a very low rate. Non-hepatic tissues contain the enzyme but depend on circulating purines and nucleosides to form nucleotides.

Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase II (CPS-II) differs in several ways from its isoform (CPS-I), the enzyme which provides carbamoyl phosphate for the Urea cycle (see IIProtein Turnover / Ammonia Metabolism ll ).

1. CPS-II is located in the cytoplasm, CPS-I mitochondria.
2. Glutamine not Ammonia is the Nitrogen source.
3. CPS-II does not require N-acetylglutamate as an allosteric activator
4. CPS-I is found only in Liver and Kidney, CPS-II in most tissues

- [6] OMP Decarboxylase: OMP ----&gt; UMP + C02 OMP is the first pyrimidine formed and is immediately decarboxylated to produce UMP. Nucleotides are then formed subsequently from UTP via CTP Synthetase.

## Regulation of Pyrimidine Synthesis

The primary site of regulation is Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase Il (glutamine) which is allosterically inhibited by UTP. Elevated PRPP increases the CPS-I1 activity to help control PRPP levels. Feedback inhibition (control) is provided by TDP inhibition of PRPP synthesis and UMP inhibition of OMP Decarboxylase.

## Deoxyribonucleotide Synthesis

- [7] Synthesis of Thymidine nucleotides first requires deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. The enzyme responsible for this step is Ribonucleotide Reductase. This enzyme acts on oxynucleotides in their diphosphate form. Thioredoxin, a small protein, is oxidized as the 2' hydroxyl group on the ribose ring is reduced. Oxidized Thioredoxin (S-S) is then reduced by FADH2 and NADPH. The products are the respective deoxynucleotide diphosphates which are further phosphorylated and then used for DNA synthesis.

The exception dUDP is first converted to thymidine nucleotide via dUMP.

- [8] A deficiency of Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) decreases metabolism of deoxyadenosine causing dATP to accumulate.
- [9] Similarly a deficiency of Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase causes accumulation of dGTP. In both cases Ribonucleotide Reductase is inhibited by accumulation of these nucleotides.
- [10] Synthesis of thymidylate requires uridine nucleotide to be converted to the deoxy form. The substrate for Thymidylate Synthetase is dUMP, the NS,Nlo\_ methylene-tetrahydrofolate (CH3-THF) is the "methyl" donor. This form of folate derives its carbon from serine:

Serine + THF ----&gt; Glycine + CH3-THF

## Pyrimidine Salvage and Metabolism

## Salvage Pathways:

Pyrimidine Phosphoribosyl Transferase: Pyrimidine base + PRPP ----&gt; Nucleoside monophosphate + PP!

Nucleoside Kinase: Nucleoside + ATP ----&gt; Nucleotide + ADP

Metabolism: Uracil is degraded to and Thymine to aminoisobu tyrate.

## Clinical Correlate: Chemotherapy

5-Fluorouracil: is a pyrimidine analog which is converted metabolically to its toxic form, fluorodeoxyuridylate (F-dUMP). As cells metabolically activate the drug it acts as a "suicide" inhibitor of Thymidylate Synthetase.

Methotrexate (MTX, amethopterin): is a folic acid analog used to inhibit Dihydrofolate Reductase.

Inhibition of the Reductase affects folate metabolism leading to decreased glycine formation from serine and decreased purine synthesis which requires CH3-THF. To facilitate normal cells folinic acid (Leucovorin) is given along with methotrexate. This acid aids normal cells by its conversion to the coenzyme of Thymidylate Synthetase, thus bypassing the block. Since the thymidine nucleotide requirements of rapidly proliferating cells are much greater than for quiescent cells folinic acid cannot meet the demands of the cancer cells.

Deoxycofonnycin inhibits Adenosine Deaminase [8] to increase the levels of dATP which inhibits Ribonucleotide Reductase. Infusing Adenosine Arabinoside together with Deoxycoformycin increases inhibition of the Reductase further via

elevated levels of both dATP and arabinoside-ATP. Since deoxynucleotides are essential for DNA synthesis this strategy is effective in treating certain types of leukemia.

## RNA Synthesis

There are a number of different types of RNA, which play different roles in the cell:

- mRNA -encodes proteins.
- rRNA -forms the ribosome, including the active site for peptide bond formation.
- tRNA -adaptor, binds amino acids and rRNA and translates between mRNA and protein.
- snRNA -small nuclear RNA, forms snRNPs, which process mRNA by removing introns.
- snoRNA -small nUcleolar RNA, forms snoRNPs, which process rRNA, mostly by methylation and isomerisation.
- si RNA -small interfering RNA, involved in gene silencing and regulation.
- gRNA - guide RNA, needed for RNA editing, the removal and insertion of bases into mRNA

- tmRNA -an RNA molecule that disengages ribosomes from stalled translation of mRNA in bacteria.
- telomerase RNA -an RNA molecule that forms much of the structure and all of the template required by telomerase.
- hnRNA -rag-bag of unprocessed pre-mRNA transcripts and other heterogeneous nuclear RN As of less well defined function.

The process of synthesizing RNA from the genetic information encoded by DNA is called transcription. The enzymes involved in transcription are called RNA polymerases. Prokaryotes have one type; eukaryotes have three types of nuclear RNA polymerases.

RNA polymerase is the enzyme that generates RNA from DNA. Cells contain 20 times more RNA than DNA: in fact, about 5% of the cell is RNA, although only 5% of this 5% is mRNA, because most of the RNA in the cell is rRNA. Since the majority of RNA is rRNA, Significantly more RNA is transcribed than translated. This is especially true in eukaryotes, whose mRNA requires processing to remove introns.

The discovery of RNA polymerase is an instructive one. In 1955, GrunbergManago and Ochoa found an enzyme catalysing:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The primary gene products of RNA polymerase (in eukaryotes) are:

- (pre-)mRNA (messenger);
- rRNA (ribosomal);
- tRNA (transfer);
- snRNA (small nuclear - spliceosomes);
- Other hnRNA (heterogeneous nuclear, such as snoRNA -small nucleolar).

The interactions of RNA after (and indeed before) transcription is now understood to be absolutely fundamental to the functioning of the cell: RNA is no longer considered to be a bland intermediate between DNA and protein, but rather an active participant in its own synthesis, processing and regulation.

RNA polymerase enzymes are very large:

- 100 kDa in T7 bacteriophage.
- 400 kDa in bacteria.
- 500 kDa for eukaryotes.

Their speed of transcription is around 50 bls, meaning an mRNA for an average protein takes about 20 s (prokaryote) or 3 min (eukaryote) to transcribe - longer in eukaryotes, despite their proteins being of similar size, because they contain introns.

The prokaryotic RNA polymerase consists of a core enzyme and an auxiliary protein factor called sigma. (0' factor). The core consists of four sub units, two are identical, a, the other two similar, and W. The W subunit binds the DNA while the subunit binds the nucleotides that are to be joined together to form the RNA molecule. Sigma factors function in identifying specific DNA sequences known as promoters. Promoters are sites that tell the RNA polymerase where to begin transcription.

Fig. 11.5 : Prokaryotic RNA Polymerase

<!-- image -->

All multi-sub unit RNA polymerases have 5 core subunits. The (true) Bacteria have an additional 0' factor subunit that aids regulation and binding to DNA.

Eukaryotes have four different RNA polymerases (RNA pol). Three are required for transcription of nuclear genes and the fourth for transcription of mitochondrial genes (Fig. 11.6). RNA polymerase I transcribes ribosomal RNA (rRNA), pol 11 transcribes mRNA and pol III tRNA and several small RNA's. The three polymerases consist of ten or more subunits. All have two large subunits with homology to the and W subunits of the prokaryotic RNA polymerase. The three eukaryotic polymerases can be distinguished based on their sensitivity to a-amanitin, a toxin found in some types of mushrooms. RNA pol 11 activity is severely inhibited, pol III weakly and pol I is insensitive. The antibiotic rifampicin inhibits prokaryotic RNA polymerases.

Fig. 11.6 : Eukaryotic RNA Polymerase

<!-- image -->

Eukaryotic RNA polymerases have five core subunits plus five common subunits.

Eukaryotes have three varieties of RNA polymerase. These differ slightly from one another: RNA polymerase II has the five core subunits plus the five common subunits, but also has two 'variable' subunits specific to RNA polymerase II only. Note that RNA polymerase II has a 'tail', which is involved in RNA processing and the initiation of transcription (Fig. 11.7).

## RNA polymerase cycle of prokaryotes (Fig. 11.8)

## Eukaryotic RNA Polymerases

Eukaryotes have three RNA polymerases which synthesized different type of RNA

- RNA polymerase I - rRNA.
- RNA polymerase 11 -mRNA.
- RNA polymerase III tRNA.

All Three have the core Subunits: ajaII are 3,11 in eukaryotes (heterodimer), become 2,1 and (il'S equivalent is 6. All three also have five common extra subunits: 5, 8, 9, 10 and 12, and a variable number of specific subunits.

## Transcription in eukaryotes differs markedly from that in prokaryotes (bacteria).

- Eukaryote polymerase is larger, with more subunits.
- The equivalent of the 'a' subunits are not identical.
- RNA polymerase cannot bind DNA directly: it requires transcription factors.
- Nucleosomes must be dealt with.
- It requires helicase (bacterial enzyme has inherent helicase activity).

## There are three phases of transcription: initiation, elongation and termination.

## Initiation

The initiation of transcription is directed by DNA sequences called promoters which tell the RNA polymerase where to begin transcription. The subunits that

enable RNA polymerases to recognize and bind promoters are called initiation factors. The initiating nucleotide can be either a purine or pyrimidine. There are numerous eukaryotic promoters with multiple promoter sequence elements. Some of the elements specify where transcription is to be initiated, others determine the frequency with which transcription is initiated at a specific gene. The initiation of transcription in eukaryotes is complicated and involves numerous factors (proteins) that must interact with the DNA and with one another to initiate transcription.

## Promoters

1. Only one strand of the DNA that encodes a promoter, a regulatory sequence, or a gene needs to be written.
2. The strand that is written is the one that is identical to the RNA transcript, thus the antisense strand of the DNA is always selected for presentation.
3. The first base on the DNA where transcription actually starts is labelled +1.
4. Sequences that precede, are upstream of the first base of the transcript, are labeled with negative numbers. Sequences that follow the first base of the transcript, are downstream, are labeled with positive numbers.

RNA pol II promoters are quite diverse. This enables the cell to choose and regulate the expression of the 50 to 100 thousand different genes encoded by its DNA. There are some sequence elements that are conserved and found in most RNA pol II promoters. There are three "boxes": TATA usually found 25 to 35 base pairs upstream, the CAAT box and the GC box both located from 40 to 200 base pairs upstream (Fig 11.9).

Fig. 11.9 : RNA Pol. II Promoters

<!-- image -->

## Initiation in RNA polymerase II

These three elements provide a basal level of transcription and are found in most "housekeeping" genes. Housekeeping genes encode enzymes and proteins that all cell types require for normal function and are usually expressed at steady state or basal levels. Other sequence elements, which are continually being discovered, serve as regulatory elements. Elements that enable a cell to specifically turn other non-housekeeping genes on or off in response to environmental signals such as hormones, growth factors, metals and toxins. The spacing and orientation of all of the sequence elements are critical for proper functioning. There is a third type of sequence element that can be located either upstream or downstream relative to the initiation site which is called an enhancer or silencer. Enhancers or silencers affect the rate and frequency of initiation of transcription.

RNA pol III promoters for tRNA are found downstream of the initiation point. These promoters consist of two elements, the first of which is located 8 to 30 base pairs downstream and is called Box A. The second element is 50 to 70 base pairs downstream and is called Box B.

RNA pol I promoter consists of a 70 base pair long core element and an upstream element that is about lOO base pairs long. The core spans a segment of DNA that includes sequences that are both up and downstream of the initiation site.

## Elongation

RNA polymerase links ribonucleotides together in a 5' to 3' direction. The polymerase induces the 3' hydroxyl group of the nucleotide at the 3' end of the growing RNA chain which attacks (nucleophilic) a phosphorous of the incoming ribonucleotide. A diphosphate is released and the 5' carbon of the incoming nucleotide is linked through a phosphodiester bond to the 3' carbon of the preceding nucleotide (Fig 11.10).

Nucleotide incorporation is determined by base pairing with the template strand of the DNA. The template is the DNA strand, also called the sense strand, that is copied by the RNA polymerase into a complementary strand of RNA called the transcript. The DNA strand that is not copied is know as the antisense strand. Note that while the RNA chain grows in a 5' to 3' direction the polymerase migrates along the sense strand in a 3' to 5' direction. Thus, the 5' to 3' ribonucleotide sequence of the RNA transcript is identical to the 5' to 3' antisense DNA strand with uracil in place of thymidine.

Fig. 11.10: RNA Elongation by RNA Polymerase

<!-- image -->

## Termination

Prokaryotes use two means for terminating transcription, factor-independent and factor-dependent. Certain DNA sequences function as signals that tell the RNA polymerase to terminate transcription. The DNA of a terminator sequence encoded an inverted repeat and an adjacent stretch of uracils. Factor-dependent termination involves a terminator sequence as well as a factor or protein called rho. The mechanisms by which eukaryotes terminate transcription are poorly understood. Most eukaryotic genes are transcribed for upto several thousand base pairs beyond the actual end of the gene. The excess RNA is then cleaved from the transcript when the RNA is processed into its mature form.

## RNA Processing

Most transcripts must be processed before becoming fully functional. Most eukaryotic RNA must be transported across the nuclear membrane where it is processed then transported to the cytosol. Processing helps stabilize and protect the RNA so it can function in the cytosol and also functions in regulating the expression of certain genes.

<!-- image -->

Mature mRNA is formed by extensively modifying the primary transcript also called heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). The hnRNA must undergo three major modifications before maturing into mRNA: capping, polyadenylation and splicing.

The roles of this modification are several:

- Prevent degradation by exonucleases: cells contain RNAses (anti-viral).
- Specific functions (e.g., binding to ribosomes, removal of non-coding sequences, alternative splicing).

Capping: all mRNA's are capped at their 5' ends with 7-methylguanylate. Guanylyl transferase catalyzes the linking of 7'-methylguanylate to the mRNA through a 5' to 5' triphosphate bridge. The capping positions the mRNA onto the 40S preinitiation complex and protects it from exonuclease activity (Fig 11.11).

Fig 11.11 : mRNA Capping

<!-- image -->

Polyadenylation: is the addition of a chain of adenylate residues, known as a poly A tail to the 3' terminus of mRNA (Fig 11.12). After the RNA is cut, an enzyme poly A polymerase, catalyzes the polymerization of adenylates. The poly A tail slows the exonucleolytic degradation of mRNA, once the tail is removed mRNA is quickly degraded.

Fig 11.12: Poly-A tail bound by PABP

<!-- image -->

Splicing: is the removal of noncoding sequences, derived from the DNA template, from the hnRNA to form a functional mRNA. The noncoding sequences are called introns while the coding sequences are known as exons. All introns have the sequence GU at their 5' ends and AG at their 3' ends. The guanyl residue at the 5' end of the intron is linked by a 2' to 5' phosphodiester linkage to an adenylate residue within the intron. The result is a lariat (loop) structure and the release of the 3' end of the first exon. The 3' end of the intron is spliced by an enzyme known as a spliceosome, which releases the loop and frees the 5' end of the second exon. The exons are then joined together.

## DNA Synthesis

- DNA replication occurs during S-phase and is initiated at origins of replication. It is semiconservative in nature.
- Replication occurs at replication forks: two of these moving out from an origin form a 'bubble'.
- DNA is only synthesised in the 5' to 3' direction: the leading strand is synthesised continuously, the lagging strand in discontinuous Okazaki fragments. This allows proofreading.
- Replication requires coordination between helicase, primase, SSBPs, two polymerases, clamps, loaders, topoisomerases, ligases and RNAses.

The discovery of the double-helical nature of DNA by Watson &amp; Crick explained how genetic information could by duplicated and passed on to succeeding generations. The strands of the double helix can separate and serve as templates for the synthesis of daughter strands. In conservative replication the two daughter strands would go to one daughter cell and the two parental strands would go to the other daughter cell. In semiconservative replication one parental and one daughter strand would go to each of the daughter cells.

Through experimentation it was determined that DNA replicates via a semiconservative mechanism. There are three possible mechanisms that can explain DNA's semiconservative replication.

DNA synthesis starts at a specific place on a chromosome called an origin. In the first mechanism one daughter strand is initiated at an origin on one parental strand and the second is initiated at another origin on the opposite parental strand. Thus, only one strand grows from each origin. Some viruses use this type of mechanism.

In the second mechanism replication of both strands is initiated at one origin. The site at which the two strands are replicated is called the replication fork. Since the fork moves in one direction from the origin this type of replication is called unidirectional. Some types of bacteria use this type of mechanism.

In the third mechanism two replication forks are initiated at the origin and as synthesis proceeds the two forks migrate away from one another. This type of replication is called bi-directional. Most organisms, including mammals, use bidirectional replication (Fig 11.13).

However, Prokaryotic chromosomes only have one origin of replication (Fig. 11.14)

## Requirements for DNA Synthesis

There are four basic components required to initiate and propagate DNA synthesis. They are: substrates, template, primer and enzymes.

## Substrates

Four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTP's) are required for DNA synthesis (note the only difference between deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides is the absence of an OH group at position 21 on the ribose ring). These are dATP, dGTP, dTTP and dCTP. The high energy phosphate bond between the a. and P phosphates is cleaved and the deoxynucleotide monophosphate is incorporated into the new DNA strand.

Ribonucleoside triphosphates (NTP's) are also required to initiate and sustain DNA synthesis. NTP's are used in the synthesis of RNA primers and ATP is used as an energy source for some of the enzymes needed to initiate and sustain DNA synthesis at the replicating fork.

## Template

The nucleotide that is to be incorporated into the growing DNA chain is selected by base pairing with template strand of the DNA. The template is the DNA strand that is copied into a complementary strand of DNA.

## Primer

The enzyme the synthesizes DNA, DNA polymerase, can only add nucleotides to an already existing strand or primer of DNA or RNA that is base paired with the template.

## Enzymes

An enzyme, DNA polymerase, is required for the covalent joining of the incoming nucleotide to the primer. To actually initiate and sustain DNA replication requires many other proteins and enzymes which assemble into a large complex called a replisome. It is thought that the DNA is spooled through the replisome and replicated as it passes through.

## DNA Polymerases

There are many types of DNA polymerases which can excise, fill gaps, proofread, repair and replicate.

## Prokaryotes:

- DNA polymerase I - repair.
- DNA polymerase 11 - cleans up Okazaki fragments.
- DNA polymerase III - main polymerase.

## Eukaryotes:

- DNA polymerase a. - lagging strand priming.
- DNA polymerase P -repair.

- DNA polymerase y - mitochondrial enzyme.
- DNA polymerase 8 -leading strand and lagging strand elongation.
- DNA polymerase E -leading strand (depends on species).

## Other Factors Required for DNA Synthesis

## Origins

Origins are unique DNA sequences that are recognized by a protein that builds the replisome. Origins have been found in bacterial, plasmid, viral, yeast and mitochondrial DNA but not in mammalian DNA. However since specific origins have been found in yeast chromosomes it is likely that specific origins are also used for initiating DNA replication in humans. Most origins have a site that is recognized and bound by an origin-binding protein. When the eis-acting factor binds to the origin the A + T rich sequence becomes partially denatured allowing other replication factors known as eis-acting factors to bind and initiate DNA replication.

<!-- image -->

Prokaryotic origins are initiated by DnaA, which loads in the DnaB helicase. Trans-acting Factors

Origin-binding Protein: binds and partially denatures the origin DNA while binding to another enzyme called helicase.

Helicases: unwind double stranded DNA (Fig. 11.15).

Fig. 11. 15 : DNA helicase uses the energy of dTIP to screw along a dsDNA molecule, melting the helix and parting the strands.

## Nucleic Acid Metabolism

Single-stranded DNA Binding Protein (SSB): enhances the activity of the helicase and prevents the unwound DNA from renaturing (Fig 11.16).

<!-- image -->

Fig 11.16: SSBPs stabilise ssDNA and prevent it from re-annealing inappropriately. Primase: synthesize the RNA primers required for initiating leading and lagging strand synthesis.

DNA Polymerase: recognizes the RNA primers and extends them in the 5' to 3' direction.

Processivity Factors: help load the polymerase onto the primer-template while anchoring the polymerase to the DNA.

Topoisomerase: removes the positive supercoils that form as the fork is unwound by the helicase. (Fig 11.17)

Fig. 11.17: Topoisomerase I Allows Strain Relief Ahead of the Replication Fork. Prokaryotic chromosomes are Mobius strips. Topoisomerase II creates gates by nicking both strands of the dsDNA, allowing helices to cross one another (Fig 11.18). Tangles and linked loops can therefore be separated. It also forms part of the eukaryotic nuclear scaffold, for similar reasons.

## DNA SYNTHESIS, S' TO 3' (Fig. 11.19)

Fig. 11.19 : DNA Synthesis

DNA synthesis only occurs in the 5' and 3', so DNA polymerases must move in antiparallel directions to synthesise the two daughter helices.

Nucleic Acid Metabolism

The major catalytic step of DNA synthesis is shown below. Notice that DNA synthesis always occurs in a 5' to 3' direction and that the incoming nucleotide first base pairs with the template and is then linked to the nucleotide on the primer. (Fig 11.20)

## DNA Synthesis is Semidiscontinuous

Since all known DNA polymerases can synthesize only in a 5' to 3' direction a problem arises in trying to replicate the two strands of DNA at a fork.

Fig. 11.21 : DNA synthesis as semidiscontinuous Process

<!-- image -->

The top strand must be discontinuously replicated in short stretches thus the replication of both parental strands is a semidiscontinuous process. The strand that is continuously sy thesized is called the leading strand while the strand that is discontinuously synthesized is called the lagging strand.

## Leading Strand Synthesis (Fig 11.22)

Fig 11.22: DNA Synthesis at 5' to 3' Direction

<!-- image -->

DNA synthesis requires a primer usually made of RNA. A primase synthesizes the ribonucleotide primer ranging from 4 to 12 nucleotides in length. DNA polymerase then incorporates a dNMP onto the 3' end of the primer initiating leading strand synthesis. Only one primer is required for the initiation and propagation of leading strand synthesis.

## Lagging Strand Synthesis (Fig 11.23)

Lagging strand synthesis is much more complex and involves five steps:

5'

Fig 11.23: DNA Synthesis at 3' to 5' Direction

<!-- image -->

1. As the leading strand is synthesized along the lower parental strand the top parental strand becomes exposed. The strand is then recognized by a primase which synthesizes a short RNA primer.
2. DNA polymerase then incorporates a dNMP onto the 3" end of the primer and initiates lagging strand synthesis. The polymerase extends the primer for about 1,000 nucleotides until it comes in contact with the 5' end of the preceding primer. These short segments of RNA/DNA are known as Okazaki fragments (Fig 11.24).

Fig 11.24: DNA primase Adds RNA primers to ssDNA. These are extended to Okazaki fragments by DNA polymerase.

3. When the DNA polymerase encounters the preceding primer it dissociates. The RNA is then removed by a specialized DNA polymerase or by an enzyme called RNaseH. Ribonucleotides are then excised one at a time in a 5' to 3' direction. The RN as eH leaves a phosphate group at the 5' end of the adjoining DNA segment thus leaving a gap.
4. The gap is filled by a DNA polymerase which uses an Okazaki fragment as a primer.
5. The 3' hydroxyl group on the 3' nucleotide terminus is then covalently joined, using DNA ligase, to the free 5' phosphate of the previously made lagging segment.

## Coordination of Leading and Lagging Strand Synthesis

Leading and lagging strand synthesis is thought to be coordinated at a replication fork. The h'Vo polymerases are held together by another set of proteins, r.y, which are near the fork that is being unwound and simultaneously primed by helicase-primase. Both polymerases are bound by a processivity factor, Upon completing an Okazaki fragment the lagging strand polymerase release the factor and dissociates from the DNA (b in the Figure). The r.y complex then loads the new factor/primer complex onto the lagging strand polymerase which initiates a new round . ..... (Fig 11.25)

## Telomerase

Leading strand synthesis can proceed all the way to the end of a chromosome however lagging strand synthesis can not. Consequently the 3' tips of each daughter chromosome would not be replicated.

Telomerase (also AKA telomere terminal transferase) extends the 3' ends of a chromosome by adding numerous repeats of a six base pair sequence until the 3' end of the lagging strand is long enough to be primed and extended by DNA polymerase (Fig 11.26).

Telomerase recognizes the tips of chromosomes also know as telomeres. The DNA sequences of telomeres have been determined in several organisms and consist of numerous repeats of a 6 to 8 base long sequence, [TTGGGG]n.

Telomerase consists of a protein and short RNA molecule that is complementary to the TTGGGG repeat in tl1e telomere. This complementary RNA sequence base pairs with the telomere allowing Telomerase to add additional complementary bases to the 3' terminus of the telomere. The enzyme then translocates 6 bases towards the 3' end so that the RNA base pairs with the last two or three nucleotides that were just synthesized . .. Telomerase then adds the next set of complementary nucleotides and repeats the cycle. Human Telomerase is not yet well characterized bu t is believed to follow a similar mechanism.

T elomeres have been found to progressively shorten in certain types of cells. These cells appear to lack Telomerase activity. When telomeric length shortens to a critical point the cell dies. Cells derived from rapidly proliferating tissues, such as tumours, have telomeres that are unusually long. This indicates that Telomerase activity may be necessary for the proliferation of tumor cells. Telomerase activity is found in ovarian cancer cells but not in normal ovarian tissue. Thus, it may be possible, once human Telomerase has been isolated and characterized, to develop anti-tumor drugs that function to inhibit telomerase activity.

Fig. 11.26 : Telomase extends Lagging strand by adding repeats of a six base pairs sequence at 3' ends

<!-- image -->

Thus, Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase with its own integral RNA template. It pairs with the telomere sequence and extends the ssDNA of the telomere.

The telomerase RNA pairs with the telomere sequence and the enzyme then extends the telomere by RNA-templated DNA synthesis. DNA polymerase can then make (all but the end) double stranded.

## Chemical Inhibitors of DNA Replication

Some types of drugs function by inhibiting DNA replication.

Substrate Analogs: analogs of dNTP's which function as chain terminators can be incorporated into DNA. These analogs are usually either missing the 3' hydroxyl group or have a chemical group, other than hydroxyl, in the 3' position.

Cytosine Arabinoside: is an anticancer drug used to treat leukaemia.

Azidothymidine (AZT): was used as an anti-HIV drug that, while effective in tissue culture experiments, proved to be ineffective for treating HIV in humans.

Acyclovir: is an effective anti-herpes virus drug.

Intercalating Agents: are compounds with fused aromatic ring systems that can wedge (intercalate) between the stacked base pairs of DNA. This disrupts the structure of the DNA so that the replicative enzymes have difficulty in synthesizing DNA past the "intercalated" sites. Anthracycline glycosides and Actinomycin Dare intercalators used to treat a variety of cancers.

DNA Damaging Agents: a variety of compounds such as Cisplatin, cause chemical damage to DNA and are used in the treatment of cancers.

Topoisomerase Inhibitors: Nalidixic acid and Fluoroquinolones are antibiotics used to inhibit bacterial topoisomerases.

## Chapter 12

## Amino Acid and

## Protein Metabolism

Protein metabolism is a key physiological process in all forms of life. Proteins are converted to amino acids and then catabolised. The complete hydrolysis of a polypeptide requires mixture of peptidases because individual peptidases do not cleave all peptide bonds. Both exopeptidases and endopeptidases are required for complete conversion of protein to amino acids.

## Protein Catabolism

## Peptidases

## Exopeptidases

Exopeptidases hydrolyse the polypeptides either from the carboxyl terminus (carboxypeptidases) or from the amino terminus (amino peptidase). Some of the important exopeptidases and their sources are given in below

## Exopeptidase

Carboxypeptidase A

## Endopeptidases

Enzymes, which hydrolyse the internal peptide bonds, are called as endopeptidases. Endopeptidases have side chain requirements for the residues flanking the scissile peptide bond. (Peptide bond to be cleaved). The important endopeptidases and their sources are listed below

## Trypsin

It is a proteolytic enzyme, present in the intestine in its inactive form (zymogen), trypsinogen. Trypsinogen is converted into its active form, trypsin, by enteropeptidase, a specialized proteolytic enzyme secreted by intestinal cells. Some free trypsin formed also catalyses the conversion of trypsinogen into trypsin. Trypsin can also convert chymotrypsinogen and procarboxypeptidase into chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase, respectively. Trypsin has different amino acid specificity when compared with other proteolytic enzymes. Trypsin hydrolyses those peptide bonds whose carboxyl groups are contributed by Lys or Arg residues and if the next residue is not proline. The number of smaller peptides resulting from trypsin action is equal to the total number of Arg and Lys residues in the protein plus one.

## Papain

Papain is widely used in brewing industry, for tenderization in meat industry, fish, food, laundry, detergents, pharmaceutical and allied indush·ies. Papain consists of a single polypeptide chain of 212 amino acid residues, cross-linked by four disulphide bonds. The active site of papain contains a cysteine residue whose sulphhydryl group is required for catalysis. It has a broad specificity for peptide bonds with wide pH range.

## Pepsin

The precursor of pepsin is pepsinogen (MW 40,000) and is converted into active pepsin in the gastric juice by the enzymatic action of pepsin itself. In this conversion, 42 amino acid residues are removed from the amino-terminal end of the polypeptide chain. The portion of the molecule that remains intact is enzymatically active pepsin of molecular weight 33,000 Dalton. Pepsin hydrolyses proteins at peptide bonds on the amino terminal side of tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan and converts it into a mixture of smaller peptides.

## Chymotrypsin

Chymotrypsin is secreted from the pancreas in the zymogen form as chymotrypsinogen and it is converted to the active form by trypsin. It reacts with the substrates protein, proteoses and peptones cleaving the peptide bonds whose carboxyl groups are furnished by aromatic amino acids.

## Amino Acid Metabolism

The amino acids not only function as energy metabolites but also used as precursors of many physiologically important compounds such as heme, bioactive amines, small pep tides, nucleotides and nucleotide coenzymes. In

## Amino Acid and Protein Metabolism

normal human beings about 90% of the energy requirement is met by oxidation of carbohydrates and fats. The remaining 10% comes from oxidation of the carbon skeleton of amino acids. Since the 20 common protein amino acids are distinctive in terms of their carbon skeletons, amino acids require unique degradative pathway. The degradation of the carbon skeletons of 20 amino acids converges to just seven metabolic intermediates namely.

- Pyruvate
- Acetyl CoA
- Acetoacetyl CoA
- a-Ketoglutarate

Pyruvate, a-ketoglutarate, succinyl CoA, fumarate and oxaloacetate can serve as precursors for glucose synthesis through gluconeogenesis. Amino acids giving rise to these intermediates are termed as glucogenic. Those amino acids degraded to yield acetyl CoA or acetoacetate are termed ketogenic since these compounds are used to synthesize ketone bodies. Some amino acids are both glucogenic and ketogenic (For example, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan and threonine)

## Catabolism of Amino Acids

Protein catabolism and anabolism are often out of sync either no additional protein is needed or the amino acid composition of the syntheSized proteins is not identical to the protein being hydrolyzed. Neither protein nor amino acids are stored as such. Thus organisms must frequently degrade excess amino acids. Two paths may be available: de aminate the unneeded amino acids and breakdown the carbon skeletons for energy or for storage as fat or carbohydrate and eliminate the nitrogen; or the nitrogen may be transferred to another carbon backbone to make a needed amino acid.

Nitrogen can be eliminated in a variety of forms, depending on the physiological conditions experienced by the organism:

- Ammonia and/ or ammonium ion. This occurs to some extent in all organisms. However ammonia is quite toxic so it must be kept at low concentrations in the body. Thus ammonia is used as the major excretory product in organisms with an essentially unlimited amount of water available to dilute it: plants, fish, many amphibians.
- Urea. Animals with readily available water (for drinking) use urea as their major nitrogenous waste product. Urea is non-toxic at low «1 M) concentrations and is extremely soluble (&gt;10 M). It is thus an excellent waste in liquid form. Used by mammals. (Lungfish have a variable
- Succinyl CoA
- Fumarate
- Oxaloacetate

environment, water to mud, and switch back and forth between ammonia and urea as appropriate!).

- Uric acid. Animals living in deserts, environmental or physiological, use uric acid. Uric acid is quite insoluble, therefore water is not needed to excrete it. Unfortunately insolubility also means it has a tendency to . crystallize out in joints etc. (e.g., small amounts in humans can lead to gout). Uric acid is thus used by reptiles and birds, including species living in or near water. The problem here is these animals all start life in a "physiological desert" within their eggs. Many birds of course also have the "migration problem" they must fly immense distances and cannot afford to carry excess water (weight). (Spiders use an even more insoluble compound, xanthine).

The important reaction commonly employed in the breakdown of an amino acid is always the removal of its a-amino group. The product ammonia is excreted after conversion to urea or other products and the carbon skeleton is degraded to C02 releasing energy. The important reaction involved in the deamination of amino acids is

- Transamination.
- Oxidative deamination.
- Non oxidative deamination.

## Transamination

There are three main transaminases or Amino transferases, all requiring Pyridoxal-P as a cofactor:

- Glutamate aminotransferase (third most active in liver): Amino acid + 2Oxoglutarate (a-kitoglutarate) ~ 2-0xoacid +- Glutamate
- Alanine aminotransferase (second most active in liver): Alanine + 2Oxoglutarate (a-kitoglutarate) ~ Pyruvate + Glutamate
- Aspartate aminotransferase (most active in liver): Aspartate + 2Oxoglutarate (a-kitoglutarate) ~ Oxalacetate + Glutamate

Most amino acids are deaminated by transamination reaction catalysed by aminotransferases or transaminases. The a-amino group present in an amino acid is transferred to an a-keto acid to yield a new amino acid and the a-keto acid of the original amino acid. The predominant amino group acceptor is a-keto glutarate.

Pyridoxal phosphate, the coenzyme of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) plays an important role in these reactions. Amino transferase reactions occur in two stages.

Pyridoxal phosphate is covalently attached to the amino transferases via a Schiff's base linkage formed between the aldehyde group of pyridoxal phosphate and the epsilon amino group of lysine residue of the enzyme. Pyridoxal phosphate is converted to pyridoxamine phosphate. In the second stage, the amino group attached to pyridoxamine phosphate is transferred to a different keto acid to yield a new amino acid and releases pyridoxal phosphate

## Oxidative Deamination

Transamination does not result in net deamination, since one amino acid is replaced by another amino acid. The function of transamination is to funnel the amino nitrogen into one or a few amino acids. For glutamate to play a role in the net conversion of amino groups to ammonia, a mechanism for glutamate deamination is needed so that a-ketoglutarate can be regenerated for further transamination. The generation is accomplished by the oxidative deamination of glutamate by glutamate dehydrogenase. Glutamate is oxidatively deaminated in the mitochondrion by glutamate dehydrogenase. NAD+ or NADP+ functions as the coenzyme. Oxidation is thought to occur with the transfer of a hydride ion from glutamate's a carbon to NAD(P)+ to form a-iminoglutarate, which is then hydrolysed to a-ketoglutarate and ammonia. The ammonia produced is then converted to urea in mammals.

Most ammonia results from the deamination of a single amino acid: glutamate, via the Glutamate dehydrogenase reaction:

<!-- image -->

This enzyme is somewhat unusual in that it can use either NADH or NADPH. Glutamate DH is activated by ADP and inhibited by GTP in vitro so they may regulate it in vivo. Of course these nucleotides would not provide a highly sensitive regulation, activity would only loosely follow energy charge.

How are the other amino acids deaminated? Most are transaminated, transferring their N to make glutamate:

## Amino Acid Oxidase

Two non-specific amino acid oxidases namely, L-amino acid and D-amino acid oxidases catalyse the oxidation of Land D-amino acids utilizing FAD as their coenzymes.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Amino acids such as serine and histidine are deaminated non-oxidatively

The other reactions involved in the catabolism of amino acids are decarboxylation, transulfuration, desulfuration, dehydration etc. The decarboxylation process i&amp; important since the products of decarboxylation reactions give rise to physiologically active amines.

## Decarboxylation

The enzymes, amino acid decarboxylases are pyridoxal phosphate- dependent enzymes. Pyridoxal phosphate forms a Schiff's base with the amino acid so as to stabilise the a.-carbanion formed by the cleavage of bond between carboxyl and a.-carbon atom. The physiologically active amines epinephrine, nor-epinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, y-amino butyrate and histamine are formed through decarboxylation of the corresponding precursor amino acids

## Urea Cycle

Location: Liver, minimal activity Kidney

Urea is synthesized from ammonia, carbon dioxide, and aspartate nitrogen using

## Kreb's Urea Cycle:

Two ATP's are required to synthesize carbamyl phosphate, the first to activate bicarbonate, the second to provide the activated phosphate on the carbamyl-P itself. Carbamyl-P is itself a high-energy compound with a mixed anhydride bond much like we saw in l,3-bis PGA. The carbamyl group is then transferred onto ornithine which acts as a carrier for the growing urea molecule. Addition of the aspartate nitrogen requires two additional ATP equivalents to drive the condensation to argininosuccinate. Lysis results in the formation of a fumerate and arginine, which is then hydrolyzed to give our product, Urea, and regenerate the ornithine carrier (Fig 12.1).

Fig. 12.1 : Urea Cycle

<!-- image -->

- [1] Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase I (CPS I): provides the substrate, carbamoyl phosphate, for the urea cycle. Allosteric Activation: N-Acetylglutamate via N-Acetylglutamate Synthase Glutamate + Acetyl CoA ----&gt; N-Acetylglutamate + CoA
- [2] Ornithine Transcarbamoylase (OTC): citrulline is exported from the mitochondria to the cytosol in exchange for ornithine.
- [3] Argininosucdnate Synthetase: uses two high energy phosphate bonds
- [4] Argininosucdnate Lyase: removes all but the amino group from Asp, fumarate is recycled back to Asp via malate and OAA in mitochondria.
- [5] Arginase: urea is produced and ornithine is regenerated.

A total of four ATP equivalents has been consumed. How many ATP equivalents are then required to convert the nitrogen of two amino acids into urea? The flow diagram supplied below may help in this calculation:

<!-- image -->

~~1Il ~~~--------------------------------------

To solve this problem we can first note the four ATP equivalents consumed in the biosynthesis of one urea from two amino acids. But the fumerate produced must be taken back to regenerate the oxalacetate used to pick up the nitrogen from one amino acid):

Fumerate + H20 \_Malate; Malate +NAD+ -axaloacetate + NADH + H+

This will provide an NADH via malate DH. This is equivalent to 2.5 ATP's, so we have -4 + 2.5 = -1.5. Next, while the second nitrogen enters via two transaminations through aspartate:

<!-- image -->

The ammonia may also produced from the first amino acid via glutamate using Glutamate DH,

<!-- image -->

This also produces an NADH, providing another 2.5 ATP's. thus the final tally is -4 + 2.5 + 2.5 = +1 ATP to produce one urea from two amino acid nitrogens. Of course for mammals this does not take into account the physiological costs of excreting the urea, which can be significant.

## Overall Reaction:

NH3 + C02 + 3 ATP + Asp ----&gt; Urea + Fumarate + 2 ATP + AMP + 2 P, + pp,

## Urea Cycle Compartmentation

The enzymes involved in the conversion of amino acid nitrogen into urea occur in the cytosol and in the mitosol and involve three different catalytic systems: the Urea Cycle, The TCA cycle, and a transamination cycle, you might call them "Kreb's Tricycle."

Note the involvement of two antiports to move intermediates across the inner mitochondrial membrane: the malate: aspartate antiport, and the citrulline:ornithine antiport. Note also that nitrogen is incorporated in the mitosol (Transamination, Carbamoyl-P synthesis), whereas the final product, urea is released in the cytosol.

## Nitrogen Excretion:

The body removes nitrogen waste in a variety of forms (Table 12.1).

Table 12.1: Various Types of Nitrogenous Compounds excreted from the body.

| Compound          | Source                                   |

## Clinical Correlate:

Aquired Hyperammonemia: may result from cirrhosis of the liver and is only cured by a liver transplant.

## Inherited Hyperammonemia

Cause: deficiencies of urea cycle enzymes, almost exclusively seen in children.

Symptoms: severity depends on proximity of defect to point of entry of ammonia into the cycle (CPS I step) can be life-threatening to no symptoms at all.

Fundamentals ofBiochemistnJ : A Textbook

A total deficiency of an enzyme is usually fatal or results in severe mental retardation.

## Causes of Neurologic Damage:

- (1) ammonia reacts with a-ketoglutarate to form glutamate thus interfering with ATP production in the TCA cycle
- (2) excess glutamate undergoes successive amination to glutamine then 0.ketoglutaramic acid, a neorotoxic cmpd.
- (3) The huge increases of a single amino acid in the blood result in limited availability of others within the brain, thus reducing rates of protein synthesis.

## Treatment:

- (1) Dietary restriction of proteins.
- (2) Organic Acid Conjugation: Benzoic and Phenylacetic Acid

Benzoic Acid: conjugated with Gly forms hippuric acid which is readily excreted in the urine. Gly can continue to be synthesized from C02 and NH3.

~

<!-- image -->

Phenylacetic Acid: conjugated with Gin forming phenylacetylglutamine which is readily excreted. GIn can be synthesized via the Glutamate DH rxn.

## Alanine Cycle

Much of the nitrogen is carried between the tissues and the liver by the Alanine Cycle. (Fig 12.2)

Fig. 12.2 : Alanine Cycle in different Tissues

<!-- image -->

A similar, but more complex cycle involves glutamate/ glutamine taking nitrogen from the muscle to the intestine where the glutamine is catabolized and the nitrogen goes to alanine which then goes to the liver. Glucose can then go to the muscle and be converted to glutamate via Glycolysis and the TCA cycle. We will not look at this more complex system.

## Catabolism of Amino Acid Carbon Skeletons

Amino acids can also be categorized as being glucogenic (can be used in Gluconeogenesis) or ketogenic (cannot be used in Gluconeogenesis). Most amino acids can be at least partially used in glucose syntheSiS. For example ilu, tyr and phe are partially glucogenic and partially ketogenic (some carbons go to acetylCoA, while the rest go to TCA intermediates), while leu and lys are fully ketogenic.

Let begin by looking at the catabolism of amino acids by groups: 3-C (feed into pyruvate), 4-C (feed into oxalacetate), and 5-C (feed into glutamate).

3-C Amino acid's: Ser and ala are converted in single step processes to pyruvate. Cys is converted after first oxidizing and removing sulfur as sulphate.

(Threonine, glycine and part of tryptophan can also breakdown to pyruvate, but we will look at other paths).

4-C Amino acid's: Asn is hydrolyzed in one step to aspartate, which in turn is transaminated in one step to oxalacetate. Threonine feeds into the TCA cycle through succinyl-CoA instead of oxalacetate. Thr is first deaminated via a dehydratase as seen earlier, then decarboxylated by Pyruvate DH Complex to give propionyl-CoA, which is then transformed via a series of steps to give succinyl-CoA.

5-C Amino acid's: Five aa's feed into glutamate which in turns feeds into the TCA cycle at 2-oxo-glutarate.

- Histidine (his) is first deaminated, then the ring is opened and the formamino group is then donated to the one-carbon pool (see later). Two of these reactions are irreversible so his is essential.
- Proline (pro) is first oxidized and then hydrolyzed to open the ring and give glutamaldehyde which is oxidized to give glutamate. Note that the glutamaldehyde tends to spontaneously refold to the ring, which can then be reduced to synthesize proline (note the two opposing redox reactions are each irreversible). It is thus not essential.
- Glutamine (gIn) is hydrolyzed in one step to glutamate.
- Arginine (arg) is hydrolyzed to ornithine by arginase from the urea cycle.
- o Ornithine is then transaminated to glutamaldehyde as seen with proline.
- o Arginine is essential for infants because the arginase removes essentially all of the arg made in the urea cycle, and glutamaldehyde's tendency to cyclize means it cannot be effectively synthesized from glutamate. (Bacteria use a blocking group to stop cyclization at this stage).

Branched Chain Amino Acids: valine (val), leucine (leu), and isoleucine (ilu). The metabolism of each of these three amino acids begins with the same theme: transaminase; DH Complex; beta-oxidation. Due to the irreversible nature of the DH Complex all three are essential.

- In the case of ilu this pattern leads to propionyl-CoA without modification. Thus you already know the chemistry to breakdown isoleucine. You should be able to show a pathway whereby the carbon in

- isoleucine is used to make glucose. Note the tissue distribution of reactions and transport.
- Val goes through the first two steps of beta-oxidation after which its structure dictates different reactions to reach propionyl-CoA.

## Protein Synthesis

## The genes tell the cell how to make proteins via transcription.

- They coined the phrase "One gene, one enzyme."
- By controlling enzymes genes control what kind of chemistry goes on in cells.
- Not all proteins are enzymes- some are structural.

## The genes have a triplet code

- Genes must have a code specifying how proteins should be made.
- Nature uses 3 base words or "codons" for the genetic code.
- o Some amino acids have more than 1 codon.
- o A gene must have a starting point and an ending point.

Fundamentals ofBiochemistnj : A Textbook

- 3 codons are stop codons (ATT, ATe and ACT).
- There is 1 start cod on, which also codes for the amino acid methionine (TAC).
- The genetic code was determined by using artificial RNA molecules (see below) to see what proteins they coded for.

## The genetic code is universal

- Apparently, all species on earth use the same genetic code.
- A pea plant can translate human genes and vice versa.
- This points to a common origin of life on earth.
- The universal code is very useful in the biotech industry- we can make human proteins in other animals and plants.
- Some minor exceptions to the universal code are found in mitochondrial &amp; chloroplast DNA and in a few protozoa.

## When proteins are made a "working copy" of the gene is made from RNA

- DNA does not leave the nucleus, but proteins are made on ribosomes in the cytosol.
- The code message must be sent from the nucleus to the cytosol.
- When a protein is to be made a working copy of the gene is made out of RNA; this is called transcription.
- The DNA strands act as templates for making RNA copies of genes.
- The RNA copy is complementary to the DNA copy and the base T is replaced by U.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- The RNA copy of the code is called messenger RNA or m-RNA.
- This arrangement keeps the DNA master copy of the gene in the nucleus where it is protected.
- The working copy in RNA is made only when it is needed and is usually rapidly broken down.

## Messenger RNA is made by RNA polymerase (Transcription)

- The RNA copy of DNA is made by an enzyme, RNA polymerase.
- Only the coding strand of DNA is transcribed.

## Amino Acid and Protein Metabolism

- RNA polymerase binds to promoter region, just upstream from the coding section of the gene (TAT A box).
- Protein transcription factors aid the binding of RNA polymerase, control RNA synthesis.
- Gene is transcribed:
- o From an initiation site (about 25 bases downstream from the polymerase binding site).
- o To a termination site (commonly AATAAA).
- o Transfer of genetic information is (Transcription is from the 5' to the 3' end almost).
- Genetic information is stored as DNA, transcribed to RNA and translated to protein:
- o DNA -&gt; RNA -&gt; protein
- Information does not flow in the reverse direction.
- o One exception: retroviruses store genetic information as RNA.
- o When they infect a cell they make a DNA copy of their RNA using an enzyme, reverse transcriptase.

<!-- image -->

## Genes have two types of DNA: Exons and Introns

- Eukaryotic cells have split genes.
- Non-coding sequences called introns are inserted in the middle of genes.
- o Prokaryotic genes seldom have introns: they are not split.
- o Prokaryotes have less room to store their genetic information.
- Coding sections are called exons.
- Both types of DNA are transcribed into m-RNA.
- Later the introns are cut out by complexes called spliceosomes.
- o Exons are ligated together.

- The messenger RNA is also given a cap and a polyadenine tail before being sent to the cytosol. (Fig 12.4)
- o GTP cap may help attach m-RNA to ribosome.
- o A long poly A tail increases the half life of the m-RNA.

Fig, 12,4 : An Overview of mRNA Biosynthesis

<!-- image -->

## Synthesis and Destruction of RNA is used to control metabolism in cells

- Messenger RNA controls the rate at which proteins are synthesized in cells.
- To reduce the amount of an enzyme a cell can decrease the rate of mRNA transcription for its gene,
- Alternatively the cell can increase the rate at which the m-RNA is destroyed.

## Protein Synthesis Translation and Maturation

Genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein, DNA encodes the information required for synthesis of proteins and a copy of the encoded information is transcribed and processed into messenger RNA (mRNA). The information carried by the mRNA directs the syntheSis of proteins, this process is called translation, Translation takes place on the surface of particles called ribosome's,

## The Genetic Code

The genetic code is a system of specific base sequences that specify which amino acids are to be used for the synthesis of a protein during translation, The genetic

code is comprised of codons which consist of a triplet of bases and specify a specific amino acid (Table 12.2). There are 64 codon sequences, sixty-one specify amino acids and three direct the termination of translation. Since there are 20 naturally occurring amino acids more than one codon can specify an amino acid. For example, isoleucine is specified by three co dons ATT, ATC and ATA. Codons that specify the same amino acid are called synonyms. Synonymous codons generally differ in the third base, thus the genetic code is degenerate. The three codons, T AA, TAG and TeA are stop or nonsense codons and direct the termination of translation.

Translation is usually initiated with the codon AUG, which specifies Methionine. The remainder of the message is read sequentially, one codon at a time, the do not overlap, translation ceases when a stop codon is encountered.

For example, the DNA sequence 5' ATGGGTGGATATCCCTAG 3' is first transcribed into mRNA 5' AUGGGUGGAUAUCCCUAG 3' (notice the difference is Thymine becomes Uracil). This mRNA is then translated into Met-Gly-GlyTyr-Pro.

## tRNA Structure and Function

Fig 12.5 : tRNA Structure

<!-- image -->

All tRNA's are similar in structure (Fig. 12.5). The TOC arm participates in binding of the charged tRNA to a site on the ribosome where protein synthesis occurs. The DHU (or D) arm is necessary for recognition by the proper aminoacyl tRNA synthase (the enzyme). The acceptor end is at the 3' terminus and ends in the sequence CAA. The anticodon arm consists of seven nucleotides, the sequence of which is read 3' to 5' (opposite convention to the usual 5' to 3'). The anticodon sequence is: 3' variable base'modified purine-X-Y-Z-Py-Py 5'. The central bases, X, Y, Z comprise the anticodon.

<!-- image -->

Each anticodon of a tRNA can base pair with a complementary codon on the tRNA. For example, Arginine is specified by two co dons, AGA and AGG but 
1 there is only one tRNA anticodon for Arg, 3 y 
1 D DeD 51. The tRNA recognizes and base pairs with either of the two Arg codons. Base pairing occurs between the first two bases of the codon and the anticodon, the third base of the codon does not match. Thus, base pairing is not strict for the last nucleotide of the codon anticodon pair, this phenomenon is called wobble.

## Ribosome

Ribosomels are found in the cytoplasm, on the outer face of the rough ER and in the mitochondrial matrix. Ribosomels are composed of RNA and proteins. The sedimentation coefficient of eukaryotic ribosomes is SOS. The sedimentation coefficient, S, is a unit of measure that describes how fast a macromolecule will sediment when spun in a high speed centrifuge. Larger molecules generally have larger S values. Eukaryotic ribosomes consist of two subunits: a 60S large subunit and a 40S small subunit. The 60S subunit is comprised of about 45 proteins and three rRNNs that have S coefficients of 5, 5.S and 2S. The 40S subunit consists of about 33 proteins and 1SS rRNNs.

Mitochondrial ribosomes are comprised of a large subunit, 16S rRNA and a small subunit 12S rRNA.

## Protein Biosynthesis Process

## Amino Acid Activation

Amino acids must be activated for translation to occur. Activation ensures that the correct amino acid will be recognized and that there is sufficient energy for peptide bond formation. Activation is the covalent coupling of amino acids to specific adapter molecules. The adapter molecules are called transfer RNA (tRNA). There is atIeast one tRNA for each of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. The tRNA recognize the codons carried by the mRNA and position them to facilitate peptide bond formation.

## Step 1

Amino acid + ATP ----------&gt; Amino-AMP-enz + PPi; enzyme: Aminoacyl tRNA Synthase

The amino is linked via the 51 position to the ribose on the ATP, liberating PPi. Notice the amino-AMP complex remains bound to the enzyme, aminoacyl tRNA synthase.

## Step 2

Amino-AMP-enz + tRNA ----------&gt; amino-tRNA + AMP + Enzyme

Fundamentals ofBiochemistn) : A Textbook

The amino group is enzymatically transferred to the 3' terminal adenosine of tRNA, liberating the enzyme and AMP.

Translation of mRNA into a protein requires ribosomes, mRNA, tRNA, exogenous protein factors and energy in the form of ATP and GTP. Translation occurs in three major steps: initiation, elongation and termination (Table 12.3 and 12.4).

## Initiation

Four major steps are required to initiate translation: ribosome dissociation, formation of a preinitiation complex, formation of the 405 initiation complex and formation of the 805 initiation complex.

## Elongation

During elongation the protein is synthesized one amino acid at a time on the 805 ribosome. This process occurs in three major steps: binding of charged tRNA, peptide bond formation, translocation of the growing peptide chain.

## Termination

When a stop codon appears at the A site translation is terminated. There are no tRNA's that recognize stop codons. Instead releasing factors, eRF, recognize the stop codon. The releasing factors along with peptidyl transferases and GTP catalyze the hydrolysis of the bond between the polypeptide chain and the tRNA. The protein and tRNA disassociate from the P site and the ribosome dissociates into the 405 and 605 subunits releasing the mRNA.

## Protein Maturation

The rate of protein synthesis is about 6 peptide bonds per minute, thus, it takes, about 1 to 2 minutes to synthesize an average sized protein. Because mRNA is often several thousand nucleotides in length, the same mRNA molecules can be Simultaneously bound by many ribosomes. An mRNA that is bound by multiple ribosomes is called a polysome. Polysomes provide a mechanism for many copies of a protein to be translated from a single mRNA. Polysomes in the cytosol synthesize most of the proteins and enzymes required by the body for intracellular processes such as metabolism.

When protein synthesis terminates, the initiator amino acid, Methionine, will have a free amino group. This end of the protein is the N terminus and the last amino acid of the chain has a free carboxy or C terminus. Protein synthesis thus initiates with the amino terminus and proceeds towards the C terminus. Proteins synthesized on the rough ER are transported across a membrane and into the cisternal spaces between the sheets of the ER where they are packaged for export.

## Amino Acid and Protein Metabolism

To be transported across the membrane the protein is synthesized with a signal or leader sequence on its amino terminus.

After it is synthesized disulfide bonds are formed and the protein folds into its three dimensional state. Some proteins require post-translational modification before becoming fully active. These modifications can include removal of segments via peptidases, addition of phosphate, sugar or lipids to specific amino acids and glycosylation (Fig 12.7).

## Translational Inhibitors

## Antibiotics

Streptomycin: prevents tRNA from binding, thus blocking the initiation of translation.

Erthyromycin: binds to the 50S subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome, blocking transloca tion.

Tetracycline: binds to the 305 subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome and inhibits binding of charged tRNA.

## Toxins

Diptheria: catalyzes ADP ribosylation of a His in eEF inhibiting translocation. A few micro grams can kill a human being.

Ricin: cleaves a single adenine from 285 rRNA and inactivates the 605 ribosomal subunit. One molecule can kill an entire cell.

## Protein Metabolism and Nitrogen Economy

A certain amount of dietary protein is required to synthesize endogenous proteins such as albumin (plasma protein), myosin(muscle filament), actin and hemoglobin. The basis for the dietary requirement of protein is the bodies inability to synthesize certain amino acids which is call essential amino cells (Table 12.5).

aArginine is synthesized by mammalian tissues, but the rate is not adequate during childhood.

bMethionine is required in large amounts to produce cysteine if the latter is dietarily lacking.

cPhenylalanine is needed in large amounts to produce tyrosine.

## Protein Turnover:

- Protein Balance: interrelationship between protein synthesis and degradation (proteolysis).
- Positive Nitrogen Balance: when dietary intake of proteins is greater than the requirement for endogenous protein synthesis.

- Neutral Nitrogen Balance: dietary protein intake and endogenous proteins are maintained at a stable level.
- Negative Nitrogen Balance: if protein intake is insufficient or if the balance of amino acids is incorrect for synthetic needs, endogenous protein is metabolized to liberate free amino acids for synthesis of essential proteins.

## Nitrogen Economy: (Fig. 12.8)

## Regulation of Protein Turnover and Nitrogen Economy:

- Insulin: increases synthesis, decreases degradation ----&gt; favors maintenance of body protein pool.
- Glucocorticoids: released during stress or starvation, oppose the effects of insulin and result in protein degradation (metabolism).

## Insulin/ Glucocorticoid Ratio

Fed State (+ Insulin): High ratio ----&gt; Protein Synthesis.

Fasting (- Insulin): Low ratio ----&gt; Protein Degradation / Metabolism.

## Roles of Protein Degradation / Metabolism:

## QUIZ

- When a diet is rich in protein, the surplus amino acids may be catabolized when they are in excess. Amino acids cannot be stored.
- During starvation or in diabetes mellitus, when carbohydrates are either unavailable or not properly utilized, body proteins are used as fuel.
- Under these different circumstances amino acids lose their amino groups and the alpha-keto acids so formed may undergo oxidation to C02 and H20. In addition, the carbon skeleton of amino acids provides three and four carbon units that can be converted to glucose to be used by body.
- Q-4. Does metabolic energy derived from amino acids varies greatly with the type of organism and with metabolic situation?

A-4.

- Carnivores immediately following a meal may obtain up to 90% of their energy requirements from amino acid oxidation.
- Herbivores may obtain a small fraction of their energy needs from amino acids.
- Most microorganisms can scavenge amino acids form their environment and can use for their metabolic need.
- Photosynthetic plants rarely oxidize amino acids for energy purpose. Instead they convert CO2 and H20 into carbohydrates that are mainly used as energy source.
- The amount of amino acids in plant tissues are carefully used for biosynthesis of proteins, nucleic acids and other molecules needed to support the growth.
- Amino acids catabolism does occur in plants and their metabolites are used for other biosynthetic pathways.

## Q-5. What is gastrin and what is its role in protein digestion?

- A-5. Entry of protein in to stomach stimulates gastric mucosa to secreate the hormone gastrin. Which stimulates the secretion of hydrochloric acid by the parietal cells of gastric glands and pepsinogen by the chief cells.
- Q-6. How protein digestion takes place?
- A-6. Protein digestion begins in the stomach, where a pro enzyme called pepsinogen is secreted, autocatalytically converted to Pepsin A, and used for the first step of proteolysis. However, most proteolysis takes place in the duodenum as a consequence of enzyme activities secreted by the pancreas. All ot the serine proteases and the zinc peptidases of pancreatic secretions are produced in the form of their respective proenzymes. These pro teases are both endopeptidase and exopeptidase, and their combined action in the intestine leads to the production of amino acids, dipeptides, and tripeptides, all of which are taken up by enterocytes of the mucosal wall.
- Q-7. How preoteolytic. enzymes are regulated?

- A-7. A circuitous regulatory pathway leading to the secretion of proenzymes into the intestine is triggered by the appearance of food in the intestinal lumen.
- Special mucosal endocrine cells secret the peptide hormones cholecystokinin (CCK) and secretin into the circulatory system.
- Together, CCK and secretin cause contraction of the gall bladder and the exocrine secretion of a bicarbonate-rich, alkaline fluid, containing protease proenzymes from the pancreas into the intestine.
- A second, paracrine role of CCK is to stimulate adjacent intestinal cells to secrete enteropeptidase, a protease that cleaves trypsinogen to produce tnjpsin.
- TrypSin also activates trypsinogen as well as all the other proenzymes in the pancreatic secretion, producing the active proteases and peptidases that hydrolyze dietary polypeptides.

## Q-8. What is celiac disease?

- A-S. Celiac disease is a condition in which the intestinal enzymes are unable to digest certain water insoluble proteins of wheat, particularly gliadin, which is injurious to the cells lining the small intestine. Wheat products must be avoided in this condition.

## Q-9. What is acute pancreatitis?

- A-9. In this condition the normal pathway of secretion of pancreatic juice into the intestine is obstructed. Thus the zymogens of the proteolytic enzymes are converted to the active forms inside the pancreatic cells, prematurely. This active proteolytic enzymes act on the pancreatic tissue itself, causing serious destruction of pancreas, which is very painful and can be fatal.

## Q-IO. How intestinal bacterial activity contributes to nitrogen metabolism?

- A-10. Many other nitrogenous compounds are formed in the intestine as a result of intestinal bacterial activity. Some have powerful pharmacological (vasopressor) effects. Intestinal bacteria convert lysine, arginine, tyrosine, ornithine and histidine to their vasopressor amines such as cadaverene, agmatine, tyramine, putrescine and histamine respectively.

## Q-ll. What are essential amino acids?

- A-11. Prokaryotes such as E. coli can make the carbon skeletons of all 20 amino acids and transaminate those carbon skeletons with nitrogen from glutamine or glutamate to complete the amino acid structures.
- Humans cannot synthesize the branched carbon chains found in branched chain amino acids or the ring systems found in phenylalanine and the aromatic amino acids; nor can we incorporate sulfur into covalently bonded structures.

Therefore, the S so-called essential amino acids must be supplied from the diet. They are:

Branched chain amino acids: leucine, Isoleucine, Valine, Aromatic amino acids: Phenylalanine, Tryptophan, Sulphur containing amino acid: Methionine Basic amino acids: Lysine and Threonine.

## Q-12. What are semi-essential amino acids?

- A-12. Histidine and arginine are not usually considered to be essential, because enough for adult needs is made by the urea cycle. However, the urea cycle generally does not provide sufficient arginine for the needs of a growing child.

## Q-13. What happens during the degradation of amino acids?

A-13. Amino acids can undergo oxidative degradation as a consequence of protein turnover; when the diet is particularly rich in protein or when

- carbohydrates are not available like in starvation or in diabetes mellitus. The degradative pathway of every amino acid requires the separation of the amino group from the carbon skeleton. The carbon skeletons enter the Krebs cycle or are channeled into gluconeogenesis. Part of the ammonia is reused for biosynthetic purpose; part is excreted directly and the rest is excreted as urea.

## Q-14. How removal of nitrogen from amino acids takes place?

- A-14. Most of the amino acids are metabolized in liver. Some of the ammonia that is generated is recycled and used in a variety of biosynthetic processes. The excess ammonia is either excreted directly or converted to uric acid or urea for excretion depending on the organism. Excess ammonia generated in extrahepatic tissues is transported to the liver for excretion after converting to a proper form. Nitrogen elimination begins intracellularly with protein degradation. There are two main routes for converting intracellular proteins to free amino acids: a lysosomal pathway, by which extracellular and some intracellular proteins are degraded, and cytosolic pathways that are important in degrading proteins of intracellular origin.

## Q-15. What happens in cystosolic pathway?

Q-15. In one cytosolic pathway:

- A protein known as ubi qui tin is activated by conversion to an AMP derivative.
- And cytosolic proteins that are damaged or otherwise destined for degradation are enzymically tagged with the activated ubiquitin.
- Ubiquitin-tagged proteins are then attacked by cytosolic ATP-dependent pro teases that hydrolyze the targeted protein, releasing the ubiquitin for further rounds of protein targeting.

Fundamentals ofBiochemistnj : A Textbook

## Q-16. How amino acid nitrogen is removed?

- A-16. The dominant reactions involved in removing amino acid nitTogen from the body are known as transaminations. This class of reactions funnels nitrogen from all free amino acids into a small number of compounds; then, either they are oxidatively de aminated, producing ammonia, or their amine groups are converted to urea by the urea cycle.

## Q-17. How transaminations take place?

- A-17. Transaminations involve moving a a-amino group from a donor a-amino acid to the keto carbon of an acceptor a-keto acid. These reversible reactions are catalyzed by a group of intracellular enzymes known as transaminases (aminotransferases), which employ covalently bound pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor.
- Transaminases exist for all amino acids except threonine and lysine.

## Q-18. Which compounds are most commonly involved in transamination?

- A-IS. The most common compounds involved as a donor/acceptor pair in transamination reactions are glutamic acid and a-ketoglutaric acid, which participate in reactions with many different aminotransferases.

## Q-19. Which aminotransferase is clinically important?

- A-19. Serum aminotransferases such as serum glutamate-oxaloacetateammotransferase (SGOT) have been used as clinical markers of tissue damage, with increasing serum levels indicating an increased extent of damage.

## Q-20. How creatinine is formed and what is its clinical significance? A-20.

- The first reaction in creatinine formation is the transfer of the amido (or amidine) group of arginine to glycine, forming guanidinoacetate.
- Subsequently, a methyl group is transferred from the ubiquitous l-carbondonor S-adenosylmethionine to guanidinoacetate to produce creatine (from which phosphocreatine is formed), some of which spontaneously cyclizes to creatinine, and is eliminated in the urine.
- The quantity of urine creatinine is generally constant for an individual and approximately proportional to muscle mass.
- In individuals with damaged muscle cells, creatine leaks out of the damaged tissue and is rapidly cyclized, greatly increasing the quantity of circulating and urinary creatinine.
- A small but clinically important amount of creatinine is excreted in the urine daily, and the creatinine clearance rate is often used as an indicator of kidney function.

## Amino Acid and Protein Metabolism

## Q-21. How glutamate is a prominent intermediate in nitrogen elimination? A-21.

- Because of the participation of a-ketoglutarate in numerous transaminations, glutamate is a prominent intermediate in nitrogen elimination as well as in anabolic pathways.
- Glutamate formed in the course of nitrogen elimination is either oxidatively deaminated by liver glutamate dehydrogenase, forming ammonia.
- The ammonia thus formed is converted to glutamine by glutamine synthase and transported to kidney tubule cells.
- There the glutamine is sequentially deamidated by glutaminase and deaminated by kidney glutamate dehydrogenase.
- The ammonia produced in the latter two reactions is excreted as NH4+ in the urine, where it helps maintain urine pH in the normal range of pH 4 to pH8.
- The extensive production of ammonia by peripheral or liver glutamate dehydrogenase is not feasible because of the highly toxic effects of circulating ammonia.
- Normal serum ammonium concentrations are in the range of 20-40 mmol, and an increase in circulating ammonia to about 400 mmol causes alkalosis and neurotoxicity.

## Q-22. Which amino acid related reaction is therapeutically significant?

A-22.

- A therapeutically useful amino acid-related reaction is the amidation of aspartic acid to produce asparagine.
- The enzyme asparagzne synthase catalyzes the ATP, requiring the transamidation reaction shown below: aspartate + glutamine + ATP --&gt; glutamate + asparagine + AMP + PP,
- Most cells perform this reaction well enough to produce all the asparagine they need.
- However, some leukemia cells require exogenous asparagine, which they obtain from the plasma. Chemotherapy using the enzyme asparaginase takes advantage of this property of leukemic cells by hydrolyzing serum asparagine to ammonia and aspartic acid, thus depriving the neoplastic cells of the asparagine that is essential for their characteristic rapid growth.

## Q-23. How clinically important are sterospecific amino acid oxidases? A-23.

- In the peroxisomes of mammalian tissues, especially liver, there are 2 stereospecific amino acid oxidases involved in elimination of amino acid nitrogen.

- D-ammo acid oxidase is an FAD-linked enzyme, and while there are few Damino acids that enter the human body the activity of this enzyme in liver is quite high. L-amino acid oxidase is FMN-linked and has broad specificity for the L amino acids.
- A number of substances, including oxygen, can act as electron acceptors from the flavoproteins. If oxygen is the acceptor the product is hydrogen peroxide, which is then rapidly degraded by the catalases found in liver and other tissues.
- Missing or defective biogenesis of peroxisomes or L-amino acid oxidase causes generalized hyper-aminoacidemia and hyper-aminoaciduria, generally leading to neurotoxicity and early death.

## Q-24. Describe the role and significance of glutamate dehydrogenase?

## A-24.

The reaction catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase is:

NH4+ + a -ketoglutarate + NAD (P) H + H+ &lt;----&gt; glutamate + NAD (P)+ + H20

Glutamate dehydrogenase can utilize either NAD orNADP as cofactor.

- In the forward reaction as shown above glutamate dehydrogenase is important in converting free ammonia and a-ketoglutarate (a-KG) to glutamate, forming one of the 20 amino acids required for protein synthesis.
- However, it should be recognized that the reverse reaction is a key anapleurotic process linking amino acid metabolism with TeA cycle activity.
- In the backward reaction, glutamate dehydrogenase provides an oxidizable carbon source used for the production of energy.
- As expected for a branch point enzyme with an important link to energy metabolism, glutamate dehydrogenase is regulated by the cell energy charge.
- ATP and GTP are negative effectors, whereas ADP and GDP are positive allosteric effectors. Thus, when the level of ATP is high, conversion of glutamate to a-KG and other TeA cycle intermediates is limited; when the cellular energy charge is low, glutamate is converted to ammonia and oxidizable TeA cycle intermediates.

## Q-25. Describe the role and significance of glutamine synthase. A-25.

The reaction catalyzed by glutamine synthase is: glutamate + NH4+ + ATP -------&gt; glutamine + ADP + PI + H+

The glutamine synthatase reaction is also important in several respects. First it produces glutamine, one of the 20 major amino acids. Second, in

animals, glutamine is the major amino acid found in the circulatory system.

Its role there is to carry ammonia to and from various tissues but principally from peripheral tissues to the kidney, where the amide nitrogen is hydrolyzed by the enzyme glutaminase (reaction below); this process regenerates glutamate and free ammonium ion, which is excreted in the urine.

glutamine + H20 -------&gt; glutamate + NH3

## Q26. What is Urea Cycle?

A26. About 80% of the excreted nitrogen is in the form of urea, which is also largely made in the liver, in a series of reactions that are distributed between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol. The series of reactions that form urea is known as the Urea Cycle or the Krebs-Henseleit Cycle.

## Q-27. What are essential features of the urea cycle?

A-27.

- Arginine from the diet or from protein breakdown is cleaved by the cytosolic enzyme arginase, generating urea and ornithine.
- Ornithine arising in the cytosol is transported to the mitochondrial matrix, where ornithine transcabamoylase catalyzes the condensation of ornithine with carbamoyl phosphate, producing citrulline. The energy for the reaction is provided by the high-energy anhydride of carbamoyl phosphate.
- The product, citrulline, is then transported to the cytosol, where the remaining reactions of the cycle take place.
- In a 2-step reaction, catalyzed by cytosolic argininosllccznate synthetase, citrulline is converted to argininosuccinate. The reaction involves the addition of AMP (from ATP) to the amido carbonyl of citrulline, forming an activated intermediate on the enzyme surface (AMP-citrulline), and the subsequent addItion of aspartate to form argininosuccinate.
- Arginine and fumarate are produced from argininosuccinate by the cytosolic enzyme argininosllccinate lyase. In the final step of the cycle arginase cleaves urea from aspartate, regenerating cytosolic ornithine, which can be transported to the mitochondrial matrix for another round of urea synthesis.
- Beginning and ending with ornithine, the reactions of the cycle consumes 3 equivalents of ATP and a total of 4 high-energy nucleotide phosphates. Urea is the only new compound generated by the cycle; all other intermediates and reactants are recycled.

Fundamentals ofBiochemistnj : A Textbook

## Q-28. How the regulation of the Urea Cycle takes place in the body?

- A-28. The urea cycle operates only to eliminate excess nitrogen. On high-protein diets the carbon skeletons of the amino acids are oxidized for energy or stored as fat and glycogen, but the amino nitrogen must be excreted.
- To facilitate this process, enzymes of the urea cycle are controlled at the gene level. When dietary proteins increase significantly, enzyme concentrations rise. On return to a balanced diet, enzyme levels decline. Under conditions of starvation, enzyme levels rise as proteins are degraded and amino acid carbon skeletons are used to provide energy, thus increasing the quantity of nitrogen that must be excreted.

## Q-29. What happens when excretion of ammonia is deranged?

- A-29. Built up of ammonia is neurotoxic. Marked brain damage is seen in cases of failure to make urea via the urea cycle or to eliminate urea through the kidneys. The result of either of these events is a buildup of Circulating levels of ammonium ion. Aside from its effect on blood pH, ammonia readily traverses the brain blood barrier and in the brain is converted to glutamate via glutamate dehydrogenase, depleting the brain of aketoglutarate. As the a-ketoglutarate is depleted oxaloacetate falls correspondingly, and ultimately TCA cycle activity comes to a halt. In the absence of aerobic oxidative phosphorylation and TCA cycle activity, irreparable cell damage and neural cell death ensue.

## Q-3D. What are the uses of glycine?

- A-3D. GlYCine is involved in the synthesis of haemoglobin, creatine phosphate, purines, glutathione, proteins, phospholipids, bile acids and detoxification reactions.

## Chapter 13

## Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is the process of converting light energy to chemical energy and storing it in the bonds of sugar. This process occurs in plants and some algae (Kingdom Protista). Plants need only light energy, C02, and H20 to make sugar. The process of photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts, (Fig. 13.1) specifically using chlorophyll, (Fig. 13.2) the green pigment involved 111 photosynthesis.

Photosynthesis takes place primarily in plant leaves, and little to none occurs in stems, etc. The parts of a typical leaf include the upper and lower epidermis, the mesophyll, the vascular bundle(s) (veins), and the

Fig. 13.2 : Structure of Chlorophyll a and b

<!-- image -->

stomates. The upper and lower epidermal cells do not have chloroplasts, thus photosynthesis does not occur there. They serve primarily as protection for the rest of the leaf. The stomates are holes which occur primarily in the lower epidermis and are for air exchange: they let C02 in and 02 out. The vascular bundles or veins in a leaf are part of the plant's transportation system, moving water and nutrients around the plant

as needed. The mesophyll cells have chloroplasts and this is where photosynthesis occurs.

As you hopefully recall, the parts of a chloroplast include the outer and ilmer membranes, intermembrane space, stroma, and thylakoids stacked in grana. The chlorophyll is built into the membranes of the thylakoids.

Chlorophyll looks green because it absorbs red and blue light, making these colours unavailable to be seen by our eyes. It is the green light which is NOT absorbed that finally reaches our eyes, making chlorophyll appear green. However, it is the energy from the red and blue light that are absorbed that is, thereby, able to be used to do photosynthesis. The green light we can see is not/ cannot be absorbed by the plant, and thus cannot be used to do photosynthesis.

The overall chemical reaction involved in photosynthesis is:

<!-- image -->

There are two parts to photosynthesis:

The light reaction happens in the thylakoid membrane and converts light energy to chemical energy. This chemical reaction must, therefore, take place in the light. Chlorophyll and several other pigments such as beta-carotene are organized in clusters in the thylakoid membrane and are involved in the light reaction. Each of these differently-coloured pigments can absorb a slightly different colour of light and pass its energy to the central chlorphyll molecule to do photosynthesis. The central part of the chemical structure of a chlorophyll molecule is a porphyrin ring, which consists of several fused rings of carbon and nitrogen with a magnesium ion in the center.

The energy harvested via the light reaction is stored by forming a chemical called ATP (adenosine triphosphate), a compound used by cells for energy storage. This chemical is made of the nucleotide adenine bonded to a ribose sugar, and that is bonded to three phosphate groups. This molecule is very similar to the building blocks for our DNA.

The dark reaction takes place in the stroma within the chloroplast, and converts C02 to sugar. This reaction doesn't directly need light in order to occur, but it does need the products of the light reaction (ATP and another chemical called NADPH). The dark reaction involves a cycle called the Calvin cycle in which C02 and energy from ATP are used to form sugar. Actually, notice that the first

product of photosynthesis is a three-carbon compound called glyceraldehyde 3phosphate. Almost immediately, two of these join to form a glucose molecule.

Most plants put C02 directly into the Calvin cycle. Thus the first stable organic compound formed is the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Since that molecule contains three carbon atoms, these plants are called C3 plants. For all plants, hot summer weather increases the amount of water that evaporates from the plant. Plants lessen the amount of water that evaporates by keeping their stomates closed during hot, dry weather. Unfortunately, this means that once the CO2 in their leaves reaches a low level, they must stop doing photosynthesis. Even if there is a tiny bit of CO2 left, the enzymes used to grab it and put it into the Calvin cycle just don't have enough C02 to use. Typically the grass in our yards just turns brown and goes dormant. Some. plants like crabgrass, corn, and sugar cane have a special modification to conserve water. These plants capture C02 in a different way: they do an extra step first, before doing the Calvin cycle. These plants have a special enzyme that can work better, even at very low CO2 levels, to grab CO2 and turn it first into oxaloacetate, which contains four carbons. Thus, these plants are called C4 plants. The C02 is then released from the oxaloacetate and put into the Calvin cycle. This is why crab grass can stay green and keep growing when all the rest of your grass is dried up and brown.

There is yet another strategy to cope with very hot, dry, desert weather and conserve water. Some plants (for example, cacti and pineapple) that live in extremely hot, dry areas like deserts, can only safely open their stomates at night when the weather is cool. Thus, there is no chance for them to get the C02 needed for the dark reaction during the daytime. At night when they can open their stomates and take in C02, these plants incorporate the C02 into various organic compounds to store it. In the daytime, when the light reaction is occurring and ATP is available (but the stomates must remain closed), they take the C02 from these organic compounds and put it into the Calvin cycle. These plants are called CAM plants, which stands for crassulacean acid metabolism after the plant family, Crassulaceae (which includes the garden plant Sedum) where this process was first discovered.

## Photosynthesis has two sets of reactions: (Fig. 13.3)

- Light reactions split water,
- o Hydrogens are used to produce a reduced coenzyme, NADPH, andATP.
- o Oxygen is given off.
- Once the NADPH and ATP are formed the rest of the reactions can take place in the dark.

- 0 C02 is reduced to glucose.
- 0 A set of cyclic reactions: the Calvin cycle.

Fig. 13.3 : Two sets &amp; Reactions during photosynthesis.

<!-- image -->

In land plants and green algae (chlorophytes), photosynthesis has two distinct stages, the light reactions, which convert light energy to ATP and NADPH; and the dark reactions, which convert C02 to carbohydrate using ATP and NADPH. Both occur in the chloroplasts (Fig. 13.4).

## Light Reactions:

Fig. 13.4 : Link between Light and Dark Reaction

<!-- image -->

## Light Reaction of Photosynthesis

The light (dependent) reactions take place on chloroplast membranes and generate ATP and NADPH. These cofactors are mostly used for the reduction of CO2 to carbohydrates, but some ATP and NADPH can be used for other metabolic processes. They only occur when light is present.

In green plants and other algae, photosynthesis goes on in the chloroplasts. These probably evolved by endosymbiosis. Some chloroplasts are probably secondary endosymbionts. As for mitochondria, the evidence is extensive.

- Chloroplasts have an outer (host) membrane and an ilmer (bacterial) membrane.
- The ilmer membrane is folded inwards to form sacs called lamellae. The membranes these lamellae are made of are called thylakoid membranes, which look just like those of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) (Fig 13.5).

Fig. 13.5 : The Structure of Chloroplast

<!-- image -->

The membranes of chloroplast are rather complex. The lamellae may occur singly, and these are called stromal or intergranallamellae (intergrana); or they may be stacked like coins, when they are termed granallameIlae (grana), and the individual "coins" are called thylakoids. In cross section, the lamellae look like pairs of membranes separating a narrow internal space (the lumen) from the external stroma.

The membranes of the lamellae contain photosynthetic pigments and an electron transport system. The lumen of the lamellae contains the oxygen generating system. The region around the lamellae (stroma) contains the C02 fixing system (dark reactions).

To understand photosynthesis, we need to know a little about photochemistry and the pigments that are involved in converting light into chemical energy. Pigments look coloured because they absorb visible light. We see the colour which they do not absorb: chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light, but not green, so appears green. Light behaves like a stream of particles (quanta) called photons. Pigment molecules absorb light one photon at a time. When a pigment

molecule absorbs a photon, it raises its electrons to higher energy levels. The

vibrational sub-state of the excited state, releasing heat, before dropping to the ground state, emitting a photon of lower energy (longer wavelength) than that originally absorbed.

## Photosynthesis Starts with the Absorption of Light

- Leaves can absorb 90% of the light striking them
- Absorption is by a number of pigments given in Table 13.1:
- Chlorophyll has a light-sensitive ring with a Mg atom in the center. It is anchored in chloroplast membranes by a hydrophobic tail.
- Plants have chlorophylls a &amp; b; algae also have 2 other types (c &amp; d: see table, p. 533 of text).
- Chlorophyll absorbs mostly light in the blue and red regions of the spectrum; it appears green because it does not absorb green light.
- o Light absorption is affected by the environment.
- o Chlorophyll a has an absorption peak either at 680 or 700 nm depending upon what proteins it is associated with (photosystems I &amp; It see below).

Table 13.1 : Light Absorption by various photosynthetic Pigments.

| Chlorophyll a   | Main photosynthetic pigment                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Chlorophyll b   | Accessory pigment:  passes light to chlorophyll a |
| Xanthophylls    | More acessory pigments                            |
| Carotene        | Another accessory pigment                         |

## Plants, Cyanobacteria and Algae are Autotrophs

- Autotrophs make their own macromolecules and do not require products from other living creatures for life.
- Other types of organisms, including ourselves, are heterotrophs: require products from other species for energy and materials.
- Photosystem I reduces NADP to NADPH. Its reaction centre absorbs maxim ally at 700 nm, and it is found mostly on intergrana.
- Photosystem H splits water (the Hill reaction). Its reaction centre absorbs maximally at 680 nm, and its is found mostly on grana, associated with light-harvesting complex H. It also contains more chlorophyll-b than PSI.

PSI! comes 'earlier' in the reaction series than PSI.

Electrons excited out of the reaction centre in the photosystems are carried along a chain. The chain pumps protons, just like the respiratory complexes, and the electrons are eventually dumped onto NADP to form NADPH. Protons flow back through ATP synthase. generating ATP.

The electron transport chain of photophosphorylation has many similarities to that found in mitochondria: many of the chemical players are the same, and much of the gist will seem familiar but reversed. We will discuss the complexes found in the thylakoid membranes in turn.

## Photo system 11

PSII is a water oxidase, and produces 1 PQH2 (plastoquinol) per water split. A photon of wavelength c. 680 nm excites an electron out of the reaction centre of PSII, and the electrons released are transported through the photosystem via electron carriers such as phaeophytin and quinone (Q) centres and are dumped onto plastoquinone (PQ to form a semiquinone radical). This generates an extremely high reducing power in a tyrosine residue (called 'Z') of the Dl subunit of PSII, which pulls an electron out of water via a manganoprotein to replace that lost from the reaction centre. The water splitting reaction is often termed the Hill reaction.

## Plastoquinone and Plastoquinol

Fig. 13.7 : Function of Plastoquinol in PS II

<!-- image -->

## Photosynthesis

Ubiquinone (UQ) ferries electrons from PSI to complex III cyt-b6/f complex. Note the long hydrophobic chain: PQ/PQH2 can migrate actually dissolved within the membrane (Fig 13.7).

Partial reduction of PQ generates plastosemiquinone radicals (PQH -), which are very dangerous and must be rapidly reduced to PQH2.

PSII feeds into a pool of plastoquinol (UQH2) actually inside the thylakoid membrane.

This is intentionally almost identical to the description of ubiquinol above.

## Cyt-bc/f Complex

Plastocyanin reductase pumps 4 H+ per PQH2 from the lumen to the stroma, and makes 2 PCRED per PQH2 oxidised. The copper in PC goes from Cu2+ to Cu+. (Fig. 13.8)

Fig. 13.8 : Function of Cyt-b6/ f complex in PS II

<!-- image -->

Like cytochrome reductase in mitochondria, this complex runs the Q-cycle, which delivers the two electrons from one PQH2 to two plastocyanin molecules, which only carry one electron each. For each molecule of PQH2 that arrives at the complex, one electron is sent back to another PQ, whilst the other is passed on down the chain, to a copper-containing protein called plastocyanin. Two rounds of this pump across 4 protons, and produce two reduced plastocyanin molecules.

## Photo system I

Rarely termed ferredoxin reductase, PSI is excited maximally by 700 nm light, and produces 2 FdRED per 2 PCRED oxidised. The electrons are passed from P700 through a series of quinones and iron-sulfur centres to the iron-containing

protein ferredoxin. Most of the ferredoxin is then immediately passed to a flavin (FMN) cofactor in NADP reductase, generating one of the raw materials for the dark reactions. The electron lost by P700 is replaced by one from plastocyanin. One NADPH is generated per 2 ferredoxin oxidised (Fig. 13.9).

Fig. 13.9 : Functions of PSI to Generate NADPH.

<!-- image -->

## ATP Synthase

Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have an F-type ATPase which generates ATP from a proton gradient. Thylakoids are permeable to Mg2+ and Cl- so this is mostly a concentration effect (pH) rather than an electrical (charge separation) effect. In fact, the pH difference can be very markpd: typically the lumen is at pH 4 and the stroma at pH 8.

Many herbicides act by damaging the photosynthetic chain. Atrazine damages the quinone binding area on PSII; paraquat takes electrons from ferredoxin and generates (lethal) hydrogen peroxide. Uncouplers like DNP (obviously) work in chloroplasts as well as mitochondria.

The whole process of the light reactions generates a proton gradient across the membrane. This is used for the chemiosmotic production of ATP. This is called Z-scheme (or straight chain) photo-phosphorylation (Fig. 13.10).

## Plzotosyn thesis

Fig. 13.10 : ATP Production through Proton Gradient Across the membrane

<!-- image -->

## Energy Budget Per Water Split:

- Water splitting adds 2H+ to the lumen.
- The Q-cycle pumps 4H+ into the lumen.
- NADPH and dark reaction effects cancel.

We need to split two waters per C02 fixed, so we double this total to 12 protons, generating 3 or 4 ATP. Only 3 ATP are required per C02 in the dark reactions, so we probably make a slight profit of just under 1 ATP per C02 over that which is required. However, sometimes, some of the electrons from ferredoxin are fed back to cyt-b6/f, short-circuiting the Z-scheme. This generates ATP via the Qcycle but no NADPH. This is called cyclic phosphorylation and enables the cell to make even more ATP, even when NADPH is not required (Fig. 13.11). Depending on the exact stoichiometry of the various complexes (still not nailed down completely), cyclic phosphorylation may be essential to satisfying the Calvin cycle's requirements.

Fig. 13.11 : Cyclic phosphorylation enables the cell to make more ATP and No NADPH

<!-- image -->

## Dark Reaction of Photosynthesis

## The dark reactions are driven by the products of the light reactions.

- The light reactions supply vital materials to the dark reactions:
- o NADPH: supplies activated hydrogens to reduce carbon atoms.
- o ATP: supplies energy to drive several steps.
- o Making a single sugar molecule requires 18 ATPs and 12 NADPHs.

## Carbon fixation is catalyzed by Rubisco.

- In the first of the dark reactions C02 gas is added to a 5 carbon sugar, ribulose bisphosphate.
- This makes a 6 carbon intermediate, which immediately splits into two 3phosphoglycerates.
- The reaction is catalyzed by ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, "Rubisco", which is probably the most abundant enzyme on earth (it is 10-25% of leaf protein).

## Calvin cycle reactions make sugar from 3-phosphoglycerate.

- The diagram shown in Fig. 13.12 is a simplified outline of the Calvin Cycle reactions which convert C02 to glucose and other sugars.
- The numbers indicate the numbers of molecules needed to eventually produce 1 glucose molecule.
- The 12 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphates formed are split into 2 groups:
- o 10 are used to regenerate the ribulose bisphosphate and keep the cycle going.
- o 2 are condensed into a glucose molecule.

The rest of the dark reactions have two purposes: firstly to regenerate the acceptor molecule RuBP from PGA; and secondly to generate some sugar profit in the form of glucose, sucrose or starch from PGA.

Two molecules of PGA are formed from the carboxylation of RuBP, one of which is labelled. After a while, other compounds became labelled. Many were known intermediates of glycolysis, and Calvin guessed that the energy from the light reactions of photosynthesis was driving glycolysis backwards to generate glucose from PGA. This is the part that generates our profit. PGA is phosphorylated to l,3-bis-phosphoglycerate by ATP (from light reactions). This is

then reduced to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP), using NADPH. GAP dehydrogenase is confined to the chloroplast. Animals also use this pathway to make glucose from Krebs cycle acids by the process termed gluconeogenesis.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Later, many sugar phosphates were found to be labelled. Everything from trioses to heptuloses: ribose, ribulose, fructose, etc. This appeared to be how the dark reactions regenerated RuBP. Sugar (phosphates) found to be synthesized -

- C3 trioses.
- o Dihydroxyacetone-P.
- C4 tetroses
- o Erythrose-4-P.
- CS pentoses
- o Ribose-S-P.
- o Ribulose-5-P.
- o Xylulose-5-P.

These sugars are all part of the pentose phosphate pathway, which is used to form ribose for nucleic acid synthesis in other organisms. The dark reactions have hijacked the pentose phosphate pathway to regenerate RuBP from GAP.

Adding these modified gluconeogenesis apd pentose-phosphate pathways together, we get the Calvin cycle. This is an extremely complicated way of regenerating RuBP from GAP, which uses up 1 more ATP per RuBP.

If every 3 RuBP carboxylated, we get 6 PGA. 5 of these are used to regenerate RuBP VIa the Calvin cycle (pentose phosphate pathway). 1 of these is used to generate sugar profit (gluconeogenesis pathway). Hence each turn of the Calvin cycle fixes 6 molecules of C02, uses and regenerates 6 RuBP, and generates one hexose profit, using 12 NADPH and F18 ATP from the light reactions (Fig. 13.13).

## Plants convert glucose to sucrose or starch.

- Plant cells have very little glucose.
- Most of the glucose is immediately converted to:
- o Starch in the chloroplasts and amyloplasts.
- o Sucrose in the cytosol.

## Sucrose is transported from the leaf to the rest of the plant through the phloem.

- Vascular plants (flowering plants, gymnosperms, ferns, horse tails, lycopods, Psilotum) have vessels which conduct fluid through the plant (see text p. 555-556 and Ch. 32):
- o Xylem: carries water and minerals from roots upward (transpiration).
- o Phloem: carries sugars and other nutrients from the leaves downward.
- Sucrose is loaded into the phloem by active transport.

## Photosynthetic gases enter the leaf through stomata

- In higher plants photosynthesis usually takes place in the leaf.
- Leaves must take up C02 and give off 02.
- Gases enter leaf through pores called stomata.
- Stomata can open and close (text, p. 701-705).
- o Surrounded by 2 balloon-shaped guard cells.
- o When guard cells swell (by osmosis) the stomata open.
- o When guard cells shrink stomata close.
- Stomata also give up water vapor.
- o Some of this is necessary to pull water through the xylem.
- o Can cause dehydration and wilting if the water is not replaced fast enough.

## Plants living in hot environments have evolved photosynthetic variations that minimize water loss.

- Plants in hot climates lose large amounts of water through their stomata when they are open.
- Must be open part of the time to pick up C02.
- Two alternative methods of photosynthesis have evolved to conserve water.

- o Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM): C02 is taken up at night when it is not as hot (less water loss).
- The C02 taken up is bound to form 4 carbon acids.
- In the daytime the stomata close and the plant does photosynthesis with the supply of CO2 taken up during the night.
- o C4 Metabolism.

## Photorespiration

## C4 Metabolism

C4 photosynthesis is an adaptation to growth in hot climates. The first products of photosynthesis are C4 acids: 'normal' plants produce PGA, a 3 carbon acid, and hence are termed C3 plants. C4 photosynthesis has evolved independently in at least 16 families of flowering plants. C4 metabolism is a way of getting round the problem of Rubisco's unfortunate oxygenase activity. C4 plants concentrate C02 biochemically in a variety of ways, so Rubisco is exposed to a very high C02/02 ratio, which inhibits photorespiration.

Some of the most productive crops are C4, including maize and sugarcane; as are some of the worst weeds, such as Amaranthus (love-lies-bleeding) and Tribulus terrestris. Provided with a high light intensity, their maximum rates of photosynthesis may be double those of C3 plants.

C4 also metabolism reduces transpiration by lowering the C02 compensation point (Fig. 13.14). Photosynthesis is slower when there is less CO2 about, and the compensation point is cipfinpn :=le: th", needed to give net photosynthesis.

Fig. 13.14 : Compensation Point for C4 Photosynthesis

<!-- image -->

At the compensation point, photosynthesis is just too slow to outrun (mostly photo) respiration. C3 plants photorespire so much, that their compensation point is c. 0.005%. C4 plants do not photorespire, so they have near zero compensation points (Fig 13.14).

Fig. 13.15 : Comparison of CO2 uptake during C3 and C4 photosynthesis

<!-- image -->

Stomata close under dry conditions, and when this happens, the levels of C02 in the mesophyll air spaces fall towards the compensation point. Since this is lower in C4 plants, they can photosynthesise with narrower stomatal apertures, so only lose half as much water per C02 fixed as C3 plants. So although we may regard the C4 syndrome as an adaptation that reduces photorespiration, as far as plants are 'concerned', it is an adaptation to reducing water loss in hot climates.

All C4 plants show Kranz anatomy. The bulk of the photosynthetic tissue is concentrated in two layers around the vascular bundles: the inner bundle-sheath layer and the outer mesophyll layer. C4 leaf veins show up as a darker green than the rest of the leaf: you can usually spot this just by holding a leaf upto the light.

C4 photosynthesis is found in both monocotyledons and dicotyledons. Most of the economically important ones are found in the Poaceae (grasses), and there are some interesting intermediates between C3 and C4, such as Panicum milioides. The genus Atriplex contains both C3 and C4 types which are still closely enough related to interbreed.

The C4 syndrome was discovery when radioactive 14C02 was fed to sugarcane, and the first products seen were C4 acids, not C3 PGA.

The receptor for C02 in C4 plants is not RuBP, but phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which is generally carboxylated by PEP carboxylase.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Oxaloacetate is then either reduced to malate; or transaminated to aspartate.

<!-- image -->

C02 fixation into C4 acids occurs in the mesophyll. C4 acids are translocated into the bundle-sheath, through plasmodesmata, where they are decarboxylated to give CO2, 2, and this C02 enters the Calvin cycle as normal. The C3 fragment is returned to the mesophyll and is metabolised back to PEP (Fig. 13.16).

Fig. 13.16 : Photosynthesis in C4 plants

<!-- image -->

There are several advantages to C4 metabolism. Firstly CO2 is released at a much higher concentration (about 10 times atmospheric) in the bundle sheath, where is competes better with oxygen for Rubisco (Rubisco is only found in the bundle sheath). Secondly, it allows net photosynthesis with less carbon dioxide, so the stomatal aperture may be held more nearly closed, and less water is lost. However, there are also disadvantages (or else almost all plants would run C4). The C3 acids produced by the decarboxylation stage must be converted back to PEP. There are three ways of doing this, and they all use up ATP. This means C4 plants need higher light levels to generate the extra ATP. This helps to explain why they are found only in hot, sunny climates.

## NADP-ME in maize

This is the first of the three C4 metabolic routes. PEP is carboxylated to oxaloacetate, reduced to malate and shunted into the bundle sheath. The malate is then decarboxylated to pyruvate by NADP-linked malic enzyme in the bundle-sheath chloroplasts. This generates NADPH, so the chloroplasts lack PSII, and make no oxygen In situ either, which is an unexpected bonus. Pyruvate is then translocated back to the mesophyll, and phosphorylated back to PEP, using 2 ATP (Fig. 13.17).

NADP-ME version of C4 metabolism: This uses the equivalent of two ATP per carbon fixation: one ATP is converted to AMP and its two phosphate groups are used, one to phosphorylate pyruvate, the other to phosphorylate phosphate to pyrophosphate, which, rather redundantly is immediately cleaved to two single phosphates. The enzyme performing this double phosphorylation is pyruvate/ orthophosphate dikinase. This is simplified in the diagram above.

## NAD-ME in millet

PEP is carboxylated to oxaloacetate, transaminated to aspartate and shunted into the bundle sheath. Aspartate then is transaminated back to oxaloacetate in the mesophyll, reduced to malate by NADH; and decarboxylated to pyruvate by NAD-linked malic enzyme in the bundle-sheath mitochondria. There is no net production of NAD(P)H so the chloroplasts have PSH and may be less effective at inhibiting photorespiration. Pyruvate is phosphorylated in the mesophyll back to PEP, using 2 ATP (Fig. 13.18).

NAD-ME version of C4 metabolism: This uses the equivalent of two ATP per carbon fixation for the same reason as was stated in the NADP-ME pathway. Note that there is no net production of NADPH in the bundle sheath, so NADME C4 cannot take advantage of dumping PS-H).

## PEP-carboxykinase ill Guinea Grass

PEP is carboxylated to oxaloacetate and shunted into the mesophyll. The oxaloacetate is decarboxylated and phosphorylated to PEP in one step using PEP carboxykinase in the cytosol. This only uses 1 ATP and may be more energyefficient than the other types; however, the reaction is freely reversible, so may not generate such a high level of CO2 in the bundle-sheath (Fig. 13.19).

Fig. 13.19 : C4 Photosynthesis in Guinea Grass

<!-- image -->

PEP-CK version of C4 metabolism. This uses just one ATP per carbon fixation. The little cycle at the top is actually a cheat: two separate transaminase reactions occur: regeneration of glutamate in the mesophyll and ketoglutarate in the bundle sheath requires pyruvate to be transaminated to alanine by glutamate in the bundle sheath, and shunted out to be transaminated back to pyruvate by ketoglutarate in the mesophyll.

## CAM Metabolism

There is a second way of inhibiting photorespiration and transpiration, and that is using a process termed CAM. Whereas C4 metabolism physically separates C02 fixation and RuBP carboxylation C02 is fixed in the mesophyll, and RuBP is carboxylated in the bundle-sheath CAM (crassulacean acid metabolism) plants separate these processes in time. CAM is even better than C4 at inhibiting photorespiratlon, and is found in plants from really arid regions.

- Cacti.
- Crassula.
- Pineapple.

The biochemiStry of CAM is very similar to C4. PEP carboxylase generates oxaloacetate; this is reduced to malate; and malate is split by NADP-malic enzyme to make pyruvate and C02. Hence photorespiration is inhibited.

## Fundamentals ofBiochemistnj : A Textbook

However, the anatomy is nothing special: there is no kranz anatomy; vacuoles in the mesophyll are often large, but not always. So how do they manage to inhibit photorespiration? The clue is in the fact that the pH of the vacuolar sap increases during the day and decreases at night. CAM plants synthesise acids (malate) during the night, and these are used up during the day (Fig. 13.20). This is a temporal separation of fixation and RuBP carboxylation.

Fig. 13.20 : The CAM Pathway

<!-- image -->

C02 is absorbed by PEP carboxylase during the night when the stomata are open. Malate is stored in the vacuole until morning and used to generate C02 during the day. The stomata can stay closed all day, increasing the internal [C02]' and this reduces photorespiration and water loss hugely.

- Transition state. The activated state in which a molecule is best suited to undergoing a chemical reaction.
- Translation. The process of reading a messenger RNA sequence for the specified amino acid sequence it contains.
- Transport protein. A protein whose primary function is to transport a substance from one part of the cell to another, from one cell to another, or from one tissue to another.
- Tricarboxylic acid (TeA) cycle. The cyclical process whereby acetate is completely oxidized to C02 and water, and electrons are transferred to NAD+ and flavine. The TCA cycle is localized to the mitochondria in

- eukaryotic cells and to the plasma membrane in prokaryotic cells. Also called the Krebs or citric acid cycle.
- Trypsin. A proteolytic enzyme that cleaves (cuts) peptide chains next to the basic amino acids arginine and lysine.
- Tryptic peptide mapping. The technique of generating a chromatographic profile characteristic of the fragments resulting from trypsin enzyme cleavage of the protein.
- Tumorigenesis. The mechanism of tumor formation.
- Turnover number. The maximum number of molecules of substrate that can be converted to product per active site per unit time.
- Ultracentrifuge. A high-speed centrifuge that can attain speeds up to 60,000 rpm and centrifugal fields of 500,000 times gravity. Useful for characterizing and/ or separating macromolecules.
- Unidirectional replication. See bidirectional replication.
- Unwinding proteins. Proteins that help to unwind double-stranded DNA during DNA replication.
- Urea cycle. A metabolic pathway in the liver that leads to the synthesis of urea from amino groups and C02. The function of the pathway is to convert the ammonia resulting from catabolism to a nontoxic form, which is then secreted.
- UV irradiation. Electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength shorter than that of visible light (200-390 nm). Causes damage to DNA (mainly by forming pyrimidine dimers).
- van der Waals forces. Refers to the combined effect of two types of interactions, one attractive and one repulsive. The attractive forces are due to favorable interactions among the induced instantaneous dipole moments that arise from fluctuations in the electron charge densities of neighboring nonbonded atoms. Repulsive forces arise when noncovalently bonded atoms come too close together.
- Viroids. Pathogenic agents, mostly of plants, that consist of short (usually circular) RNA molecules.
- Virus. A complex of nucleic-acid and protein, that can infect and replicate inside a specific host cell to make more virus particles.
- Vitamin. A trace organic substance required in the diet of some species. Many vitamins are precursors of coenzymes.

- Watson-Crick base pairs. The type of hydrogen-bonded base pairs found in DNA, or comparable base pairs found in RNA. The base pairs are A-T, GC, and A-U.
- Western blot. Similar in principle to a Southern blot, but where the species adsorbed to the nitrocellulose filter is a protein, and the detection makes use of specific antibodies.
- Wild-type gene. The form of a gene (allele) normally found in nature.
- Wobble. A proposed explanation for base pairing that is not of the WatsonCrick type and that often occurs between the 3' base in the codon and the 5' base in the anticodon.
- X-ray crystallography. A technique for determining the structure of molecules from the X-ray diffraction patterns that are produced by crystalline arrays of the molecules.
- Ylid. A compound in which adjacent, covalently-bonded atoms, both having an electronic octet, have opposite charges.
- Z form. A duplex DNA structure in which there is the usual type of hydrogen bonding between the base pairs but in which the helix formed by the two polynucleotide chains is left-handed rather than right-handed.
- Zwitterion. A dipolar ion with spatially-separated positive and negative charges. For example, most amino acids are zwitterions, having a positive charge on the a-amino group and a negative charge on the a-carboxyl group but no net charge on the overall molecule.
- Zygote. A cell that results from the union of haploid male and female sex cells. Zygotes are diploid.
- Zymogen. An inactive precursor of an enzyme. For example, trypsin exists in the inactive form trypsinogen before it is converted to its active form, trypsin.
