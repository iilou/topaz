steps:

frontend
ux side
user
starts new chat
stores new chat data in ss memory (no db persistence)
loop until user closes tab:
    enters prompt
    sent to server
    server parses prompt for intent 
    match it with predefined set of intents, otherwise ask user for clarification
    for intent, feed to llm with previous chat data
    append to existing chat data
    send to user

backend
knowledge bank
    kvps to feed llm for different scenarios
    chunked as much as possible
vectorized thingy
    i dont know what this would look like can you explain
fine tuned llm for speaking patterns (optional)
intent list that maps to different things from the knowledge bank
ephermeral storage of user conversations (no auth)

Application Objectives

Frontend

Provide a session-based tutoring chat interface

Maintain ephemeral in-memory chat state per session

Support iterative question refinement without user authentication

Backend

Perform intent detection on user queries using fuzzy matching and semantic similarity

Route user queries to intent-specific instructional components

Retrieve structured knowledge chunks using vector similarity and metadata filtering

Assemble context-aware prompts for an LLM-based tutoring agent

Maintain lightweight session state (topic, intent, step index)

Return adaptive, step-aligned explanations to the frontend

Knowledge System

Curate a structured, chunked calculus knowledge base

Annotate content with pedagogical roles (intuition, procedure, mistakes)

Enable targeted retrieval aligned with learning intent

LLM Integration

Use an LLM for natural language explanation and adaptation

Avoid reliance on the LLM for pedagogical decision-making

Optionally support fine-tuning for tutoring tone
